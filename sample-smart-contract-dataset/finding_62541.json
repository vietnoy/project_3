    "content": "\n_Resolved_\n\n## Severity\n\n**Impact:** High\n\n**Likelihood:** Medium\n\n## Description\n\nThe `calculatePendingPrizesForRarity` function in the `SpinLottery` contract implements a minimum guarantee mechanism where, if `_prizeCount` is greater than `1` and the `weight` is greater than `0`, the `pendingCount` is conservatively set to 1.\n\n```solidity\n        // Ensure at least some prizes are allocated if weights allow it\n        if (_prizeCount > 1 && pendingCount == 0 && weight > 0) {\n            pendingCount = 1;\n        }\n```\nIn the `spin` function, the `pendingCounts` are locked, and if the total available prizes are insufficient, it can lead to an `InsufficientPrizes` error, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n```solidity\n        for (uint8 i = 1; i <= maxRarityId; i++) {\n            if (rarityConfigs[i].active) {\n                pendingCounts[i] = calculatePendingPrizesForRarity(_prizeCount, i);\n                totalPending += pendingCounts[i];\n            }\n        }\n        ...\n        // Check if enough prizes are available considering pending ones\n        for (uint8 i = 1; i <= maxRarityId; i++) {\n            if (pendingCounts[i] > 0) {\n                uint256 available = getAvailablePrizes(i);\n                uint256 pending = prizePools[i].pendingCount;\n                \n                if (available - pending < pendingCounts[i]) {\n                    revert InsufficientPrizes();\n                }\n            }\n        }\n```\n\nThis situation is exacerbated when **a high-value prize (`rarity`) has a low number of `available` prizes**. \n\nAn attacker or normal user could initiate multiple `spin` transactions with `_prizeCount = 2`, effectively locking the limited prizes and temporarily preventing other users from participating in the lottery, leading to frequent DoS scenarios for a certain period of time, which leads to bad user experience.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nThe relevant locking logic should be refined to fix this issue.\n\n\n\n",
    "summary": "\nA bug was found in the `SpinLottery` contract where users can temporarily prevent others from participating in the lottery. This is caused by a minimum guarantee mechanism that sets a conservative value for `pendingCount` if certain conditions are met. This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) situation when the total available prizes are insufficient. To fix this, the locking logic needs to be refined.",
