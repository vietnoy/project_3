    "content": "## Severity: Low Risk\n\n## Context\n(No context files were provided by the reviewer)\n\n## Description\nThe current implementation of `createProposal` does not perform any sanity check on the length of the action length attached to a proposal. Users could create proposals that will revert during the execution because the loop on the action's execution will revert with an Out Of Gas error.\n\n## Recommendation\nOn the `Dao.sol` contract, for example, the action's length is bound to a maximum of 256 actions. Aragon should consider using the same upper bound or even better lowering it given that proposals could be created by \"normal\" token holders and not \"authed\" users.\n\n## Aragon's Response\nWe acknowledge the finding.\n- The gas cost of having 256 or more actions is very high, if not exceeding the gas limit.\n- There is no incentive to spend a lot of money to create a proposal that will not execute.\n- Even so, the actions can always be submitted as 2+ proposals.\n- For veto-focused scenarios, we don't expect more than 1~2 actions in total.\n\n## Spearbit's Response\nAcknowledged.",
