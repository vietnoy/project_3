    "content": "\n_Resolved_\n\nThe `YuzuIssuer.maxWithdraw()` returns the maximum amount of assets that can be withdrawn by a user without considering withdrawal fees.\n\n```solidity\nfunction maxWithdraw(address _owner) public view virtual returns (uint256) {\n    return Math.min(previewRedeem(_maxRedeem(_owner)), _maxWithdraw(_owner));\n}\n\nfunction _maxWithdraw(address) internal view virtual returns (uint256) {\n    return liquidityBufferSize();\n}\n\nfunction liquidityBufferSize() public view virtual override returns (uint256) {\n    return super.liquidityBufferSize() - totalUnfinalizedOrderValue();\n}\n```\n\nWhen a user attempts to withdraw assets:\n1. User has 100 shares in the vault.\n2. `previewRedeem(100)` returns ~90 assets (after 10% fee).\n3. `_maxWithdraw()` returns 50 assets as the current maximum withdrawable amount.\n4. User calls `withdraw(50, user, user)`.\n5. The withdrawal process calculates:\n   ```solidity\n   fee = _feeOnRaw(50, redeemFeePpm)\n   // fee = 50 * 0.1e6 / 1e6 = 5 assets\n   \n   tokens = previewWithdraw(50)\n   // tokens = 55 shares (equivalent to 50 assets + 5 assets fee)\n   ```\n6. The actual assets that should be left in the vault are 55 (50 + 5 fee), which exceeds the reported `_maxWithdraw()` value of 50 assets, yet the transaction is still allowed.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nConsider updating `maxWithdraw()` to account for fees by calculating the net withdrawable amount after fees are applied.\n\n\n\n",
