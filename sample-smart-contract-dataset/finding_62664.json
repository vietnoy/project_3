    "content": "##### Description\nThis issue has been identified within the `updateA` function of the `SelfPeggingAsset` contract.\n\nThe parameter `A` can be changed abruptly in a single transaction, which could significantly alter the price curve. If the pool is imbalanced, an unexpected `A` increase can create arbitrage opportunities, exposing liquidity providers to sudden risks or losses.\n\nThis is classified as **medium** severity because abrupt changes may lead to notable losses for honest LPs who have little time to react.\n\n##### Recommendation\nWe recommend implementing a public timelock or a gradual-style mechanism. This would give liquidity providers time to exit or rebalance before a major curve adjustment, mitigating sudden changes and reducing unintended impermanent loss risks.\n",
    "summary": "\nThe report identifies a problem in the `updateA` function of the `SelfPeggingAsset` contract. This function allows the parameter `A` to be changed too quickly, which can cause the price curve to change significantly. This could create opportunities for people to take advantage of imbalances in the pool, leading to potential losses for liquidity providers. The severity of this issue is medium, as it could result in significant losses for honest liquidity providers who may not have enough time to react. To address this, the report recommends implementing a public timelock or gradual-style mechanism to give liquidity providers time to adjust before major changes occur. This would help reduce the risks of sudden changes and minimize potential losses.",
