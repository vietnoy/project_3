    "content": "\n_Resolved_\n\nIn the `SpinLottery` contract, once an NFT is added to the prize pool, there is no mechanism for retrieving it other than through the lottery process.\n\n```solidity\n    function _distributePrize(address player, uint256 requestId, uint8 rarity, uint256 prizeRandom) external {\n        // Only allow this contract to call this function\n        if (msg.sender != address(this)) revert(\"Unauthorized\");\n        \n        (address nftAddress, uint88 tokenId) = _claimPrize(rarity, prizeRandom);\n        IERC721(nftAddress).transferFrom(address(this), player, tokenId);\n        emit PrizeWon(player, requestId, nftAddress, tokenId, rarity);\n    }\n```\n\nIf a rarity is marked as inactive via `configureRarity`, any NFTs associated with that rarity become effectively locked and cannot be retrieved. \n\n```solidity\n        // Update configuration\n        rarityConfigs[_rarityId] = RarityConfig({\n            weight: _weight,\n            basePrice: _basePrice,\n            active: _active\n        });\n```\n\nTo address this issue, implement a mechanism that allows admins to retrieve their NFTs if the associated `rarity` becomes inactive. \n\n\n\n",
