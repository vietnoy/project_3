This means that if `addRequestManager` is called for an address that already has the `REQUEST_MANAGER` role, or `removeRequestManager` is called for an address that does not, the corresponding event will still be emitted, which could be misleading for off-chain services that rely on these events to track state changes. Furthermore, these events are redundant, considering the fact that the `AccessControlUpgradeable` contract already emits the `RoleGranted` and `RoleRevoked` events.\n\nConsider removing the `RequestManagerAdded` and `RequestManagerRemoved` events entirely.\n\n***Update:** Resolved in [pull request #23](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/managed-oracle/pull/23) at commit [46774d9](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/managed-oracle/pull/23/commits/46774d9ebba77616a2802cca960e43052934e397).*",
