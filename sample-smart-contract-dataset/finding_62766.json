    "content": "\n_Resolved_\n\nThe `YuzuProto.withdrawCollateral()` allows admins to withdraw excess collateral from the protocol by specifying the amount of assets they want to withdraw, and this function relies on `liquidityBufferSize()` to determine the maximum withdrawable amount.\n\nThe `liquidityBufferSize()` calculation subtracts `totalUnfinalizedOrderValue()` from the contract's asset balance, which can be reduced by pending redemption orders.\n\n```solidity\nfunction withdrawCollateral(uint256 assets, address receiver) public virtual {\n    uint256 liquidityBuffer = liquidityBufferSize();\n    if (assets > liquidityBuffer) {\n        revert ExceededLiquidityBuffer(assets, liquidityBuffer);\n    }\n    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(asset()), receiver, assets);\n    emit WithdrawnCollateral(receiver, assets);\n}\n\nfunction liquidityBufferSize() public view virtual override returns (uint256) {\n    return super.liquidityBufferSize() - totalUnfinalizedOrderValue();\n}\n```\nWhen users perform instant withdrawals, they can reduce the available `liquidityBufferSize()` by consuming available liquidity. This creates a situation where legitimate admin collateral withdrawals might fail unexpectedly.\n\nThis can occur either through normal user operations or by intentionally executing small instant withdrawals (dust amounts) that incur small/zero fees.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nConsider allowing admins to withdraw the maximum available amount by implementing a special flag (such as passing `type(uint256).max`) that would withdraw the remaining available liquidity buffer.\n\n\n\n",
