    "content": "**Update**\nThe client fixed the issue in commit `f797e3043714ac28f58aed6bdb059f3398368f91` and provided the following explanation:\n\n> Already fixed in this commit on Apr 4\n\n**File(s) affected:**`contracts/Factory.vy`\n\n**Description:** If the `Factory` creates a market using `add_market()` before a `staker_impl` is set, a staker can be added later by calling the `fill_staker_vpool()` function. However, this function does not call the `LT.setStaker()` function to update the staker in the `LT` contract.\n\n**Recommendation:** Add the missing external call to mirror the behavior in `add_market()`.",
    "summary": "\nA bug was reported in a program called `Factory.vy`, where a function called `fill_staker_vpool()` was not updating the staker in the `LT` contract. This was only happening if a market was created using `add_market()` before a `staker_impl` was set. The client has fixed the issue and provided a commit number for reference. The recommendation is to add an external call to fix the issue.",
