    "title": "Fee-On-Transfer Tokens Not Supported",
    "content": "##### Description\nThis issue has been identified in the contract’s token-handling logic (for example, in the `mint`, `swap`, and `redeem` functions). The contract assumes standard ERC20 transfers without accounting for fee-on-transfer tokens (e.g., USDT and USDC, which currently have fees set at 0%). This can result in smaller received amounts than expected, causing unpredictable behavior or potential loss of funds.\n\nThe issue is classified as **low** severity because it only affects scenarios where a token has a fee-on-transfer mechanism.\n\n##### Recommendation\nWe recommend either disallowing fee-on-transfer tokens in the `swap` and `mint` functions by reverting when the received balance does not match the expected amount, or calculating the invariants after the transfer is performed, using the actual balance increase.\n",
