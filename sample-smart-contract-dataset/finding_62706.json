    "content": "##### Description\nThis issue has been identified in the `mintFresh` and `redeemFresh` functions. Both enforce that only one of two parameters (`mintTokensIn` and `mintAmountIn` for `mintFresh`; `redeemTokensIn` and `redeemAmountIn` for `redeemFresh`) can be non-zero at a time. If both are provided as non-zero, the code reverts with `CommonError.ZeroValue()` — an error name that does not accurately describe the situation.\n\nBecause `ZeroValue` suggests that a parameter was unexpectedly zero, it can confuse developers attempting to diagnose a revert. In reality, the revert is caused by providing two non-zero parameters simultaneously.\n\n##### Recommendation\nWe recommend replacing the `ZeroValue` error with a more descriptive name—for example, `NonZeroValuesNotAllowed` or `OnlyOneInputAllowed`. This ensures the revert message accurately describes why the check fails and simplifies debugging.\n",
