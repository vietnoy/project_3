    "content": "## Severity: Medium Risk\n\n## Context\n- Copium.sol#L57-L64\n- Copium.sol#L102-L116\n\n## Summary\nThe `assignTeam` modifier does not revert when a user specifies a `different_team` than the one they were initially assigned to. This can lead to incorrect deposit accounting in the `createYeet` method, where `teamDeposits` is credited to the wrong team.\n\n## Finding Description\nThe `assignTeam` modifier is intended to assign a user to a team if they have not already been assigned. However, it does not validate that the `_team` parameter matches the user's existing team in `userTeams`. As a result, when a user calls `createYeet` with a different `_team`, the deposit is credited to the new team, even though the user's `userTeams` mapping remains unchanged.\n\n## Impact Explanation\n1. **Incorrect deposit tracking:** Deposits are credited to the wrong team, leading to inconsistencies in the `teamDeposits` mapping.\n2. **Potential exploitation:** A malicious user could manipulate team deposit totals by repeatedly calling `createYeet` with different `_team` values.\n\n## Likelihood Explanation\nIt requires minimal effort for a user to specify a `different_team` in the `createYeet` method, which can originate from a mistake or malicious intent.\n\n## Recommendation\nIt is recommended to update the `assignTeam` modifier to revert if the user specifies a `_team` that differs from their already assigned team:\n\n```solidity\nmodifier assignTeam(address _user, Team _team) {\n    if (_team == Team.None) revert InvalidTeam();\n    if (userTeams[_user] == Team.None) {\n        userTeams[_user] = _team;\n        addressByTeam[_team].push(_user);\n    } else if (userTeams[_user] != _team) {\n        revert TeamAlreadyAssigned();\n    }\n    _;\n}\n```\n\n## Semantic Layer\nFixed in PR 1.\n\n## Spearbit\nFix verified.",
    "summary": "\nThis report discusses a bug in the Copium smart contract that can cause incorrect deposit tracking and potential exploitation. The `assignTeam` modifier, which assigns a user to a team, does not check if the specified team matches the user's existing team. As a result, when a user calls the `createYeet` method with a different team, the deposit is credited to the new team instead of the user's original team. This can be easily exploited by a malicious user, and it is recommended to update the `assignTeam` modifier to revert if the specified team differs from the user's assigned team. The bug has been fixed in a pull request and verified by Spearbit.",
