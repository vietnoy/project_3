    "content": "**Update**\nMarked as \"Acknowledged\" by the client. The client provided the following explanation:\n\n> we have forked the official WETH9 contract and don't plan to change it\n\n**File(s) affected:**`WrappedCAMP.sol`\n\n**Description:** This contract mints wrapped tokens in a 1:1 ratio for native token deposits. The `totalSupply()` of this token contract is determined by querying `address(this).balance`. However, the balance of the contract can differ from the total sum of deposits if another contract forces a native token transfer using `selfdestruct`, which circumvents the otherwise correctly implemented `receive()` function. This opcode is deprecated, but currently still supported and can be used in this manner.\n\n**Exploit Scenario:**\n\n1.   Alice deposits 10 CAMP for 10wCAMP, `totalSupply` is 10.\n2.   Mallory creates a malicious contract and uses `selfdestruct` to force 10 tokens into the token contract, `totalSupply` is now 20.\n3.   Ted observes the contract, it appears as if wCAMP may have depegged from CAMP since the sum of balances does not equal `totalSupply`.\n\n**Recommendation:** Manage accounting of `totalSupply` in a seperate contract variable that is inreased on deposits and decreased on withdraws. Optionally add a `recoverExtraTokens()` access controlled function that allows the recovery of the difference between the contract balance and the `totalSupply`.",
