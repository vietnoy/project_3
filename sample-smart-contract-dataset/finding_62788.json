    "content": "**Update**\nMarked as \"Fixed\" by the client. Addressed in: `ca194fd861d7406c934a01ed91b06205da2f067d`.\n\nAdditional fix in: `8e41143cf6839753b027569e24f70a88dffd2388`.\n\n**File(s) affected:**`contracts/CampTimelockEscrow.sol`\n\n**Description:** The `bridgeOut()` and `release()` functions allow the caller to specify a `_gaslimit` argument. This value is the maximum amount of gas units the executor should use on the destination chain when completing the bridge. However, in the case of the `CampTimelockEscrow` contract, there is never any validation that some minimum amount of gas is available on the destination chain to ensure the bridge transaction is successful. Therefore, User A could process User B's deposit via the `release()` function, specifying a very small `_gaslimit`, causing the transaction to fail on the destination chain. This means the affected user would have directly to call the `lzReceive()` function on the target chain's implementation of the Camp OFT contract in order to complete their bridge action successfully.\n\n**Recommendation:** As the `CampTimelockEscrow` contract never attaches any data within its `SendParam` struct, it should be possible to estimate a minimum amount of gas required on the target chain to complete a basic bridge action (`MIN_GAS_LIMIT`) and validate that `_gaslimit >= MIN_GAS_LIMIT`.",
    "summary": "\nA bug has been reported in the `CampTimelockEscrow.sol` file, where the `bridgeOut()` and `release()` functions do not have a minimum gas validation. This means that a user could specify a very small gas limit, causing the transaction to fail on the destination chain. The recommendation is to add a minimum gas validation to ensure successful bridge transactions.",
