    "content": "\n_Acknowledged_\n\nIn `deusd_lp_staking.move` function `withdraw()`, the cooldown duration is read from current parameters at withdrawal time, not locked when user unstakes. Admin can change cooldown periods mid-stream, affecting users who have already begun cooling down.\n\nLet's check this **scenario:**\n1. User unstakes 1000 tokens when cooldown = 30 days.\n2. User expects withdrawal on Day 30.\n3. Admin updates cooldown to 60 days on Day 20.\n4. User tries withdrawing on Day 30 → fails because `assert!(current_time >= stake_data.cooldown_start_timestamp + params.cooldown, ECooldownNotOver);` now requires 60 days.\n\nThe **root cause** is that `params.cooldown` always reads current global setting, not the duration that was active when the user started cooldown.\n\nOne clear and concrete impact is **unpredictable withdrawal times**, users cannot reliably plan when their funds will be available, as the admin can retroactively extend lockup periods.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nRecommendation is to lock the cooldown duration at unstaking time:\n\n```move\npublic struct StakeData has store, copy, drop {\n    staked_amount: u64,\n    cooling_down_amount: u64,\n    cooldown_start_timestamp: u64,\n    locked_cooldown_duration: u64,  // ADD: Store duration when unstaking\n}\n\n// In unstake():\nstake_data.locked_cooldown_duration = params.cooldown;\n\n// In withdraw():\nassert!(current_time >= stake_data.cooldown_start_timestamp + stake_data.locked_cooldown_duration, ECooldownNotOver);\n```\n\nAnother solution will be to document clearly that cooldown periods can change anytime and apply retroactively, ensuring users understand this risk before unstaking.\n\n\n",
