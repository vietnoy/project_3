    "title": "[ZLS1-4] User Can Bypass Locking Period Without Penalty Using emergencyWithdraw",
    "content": "**Severity:** Medium\n\n**Path:** contracts/ZealousSwapFarms.sol#L424-L440 \n\n**Description:** When a user deposits tokens, they can’t withdraw them until the locking period has passed. This is enforced in the `withdraw` function with the following check:\n```\nfunction withdraw(uint256 _pid, uint256 _amount) public nonReentrant {\n  -- snip -- \n  require(\n      block.number >= user.lastInteraction + lockingPeriod,\n      \"ZealousSwapFarms: Tokens are still locked\"\n  );\n```\nHowever, the `emergencyWithdraw` function does not have this restriction. This means a user can bypass the locking period and immediately withdraw their tokens by calling `emergencyWithdraw`.\n```\nfunction emergencyWithdraw(uint256 _pid) public nonReentrant {\n    require(_pid < poolInfo.length, \"ZealousSwapFarms: Invalid pool ID\");\n\n    PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];\n    UserInfo storage user = userInfo[_pid][msg.sender];\n\n    uint256 amount = user.amount;\n    require(amount > 0, \"ZealousSwapFarms: No LP tokens staked\");\n\n    user.amount = 0;\n    user.rewardDebt = 0;\n\n    pool.totalDeposited = pool.totalDeposited - amount;\n    pool.lpToken.safeTransfer(address(msg.sender), amount);\n\n    emit EmergencyWithdraw(msg.sender, _pid, amount);\n}\n```\n\n\n**Remediation:**  To prevent users from bypassing the locking mechanism using `emergencyWithdraw`, introduce a penalty mechanism. For example, deduct a percentage (5–10%) from the withdrawn amount when `emergencyWithdraw` is used. \n\n**Status:** Fixed\n\n- - -",
    "summary": "\nA bug has been reported in the ZealousSwapFarms smart contract that allows users to bypass the locking period for withdrawing tokens by using the `emergencyWithdraw` function. This function does not have the same restriction as the `withdraw` function, which enforces the locking period. This means that users can immediately withdraw their tokens without waiting for the locking period to end. To fix this, a penalty mechanism should be introduced, such as deducting a percentage of the withdrawn amount. This issue has been addressed and is now fixed.",
