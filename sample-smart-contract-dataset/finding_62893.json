    "content": "## High Risk Security Issue\n\n**Severity**: High Risk  \n**Context**: (No context files were provided by the reviewer)  \n**Description**: (Issue found in commit hash `fc820c9ee9ab310c4fdd5e1888f72164c0b871c8`).\n\nIt is possible to cause a denial-of-service to RPC nodes via `eth_call` by using a state override on the staking contract. The problem is that there exists a `MONAD_ASSERT` on the staking contract that checks if the current contract balance is `>=` the amount of the withdrawal request during `precompile_withdraw`.\n\n```cpp\nResult<byte_string> StakingContract::precompile_withdraw(\n    byte_string_view const input, evmc_address const &msg_sender,\n    evmc_uint256be const &)\n{\n    // ...\n    auto withdrawal_request_storage =\n        vars.withdrawal_request(val_id, msg_sender, withdrawal_id);\n    auto withdrawal_request = withdrawal_request_storage.load_checked();\n    if (MONAD_UNLIKELY(!withdrawal_request.has_value())) {\n        return StakingError::UnknownWithdrawalId;\n    }\n    // ...\n    auto const contract_balance =\n        intx::be::load<uint256_t>(state_.get_balance(STAKING_CA));\n    MONAD_ASSERT(contract_balance >= withdrawal_amount);\n    send_tokens(msg_sender, withdrawal_amount);\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nHence, it is possible with the `eth_call` state override feature, to set the staking contract balance to 0, or set the `withdrawal_amount` stored in the `withdrawal_request` to be greater than the staking contract balance. This will cause the `MONAD_ASSERT` to fail, therefore causing a denial-of-service of the RPC node.\n\n**Recommendation**: Either use `MONAD_ASSERT_THROW` that throws a program exception that is handled in `eth_call` instead of `MONAD_ASSERT` which will abort, or revert earlier if `withdrawal_amount > contract_balance`.\n\n**Category**: Labs  \n**Status**: Fixed in PR 1606  \n**Spearbit**: Fix verified.",
    "summary": "\nThis bug report describes a high-risk security issue in a commit with the hash `fc820c9ee9ab310c4fdd5e1888f72164c0b871c8`. The issue allows for a denial-of-service attack on RPC nodes using the `eth_call` function and a state override on the staking contract. This is due to a `MONAD_ASSERT` statement in the staking contract that checks the contract balance during a withdrawal request. By manipulating the contract balance or withdrawal amount, it is possible to trigger the `MONAD_ASSERT` and cause the RPC node to fail. The report recommends using `MONAD_ASSERT_THROW` instead of `MONAD_ASSERT` or reverting earlier in the process to prevent this attack. The bug has been fixed in PR 1606 and has been verified as fixed. ",
