    "title": "Wallet displays non-printable characters as whitespace in signature requests",
    "content": "## Vulnerability Report\n\n## Difficulty\nLow\n\n## Type\nConfiguration\n\n## Description\nThe wallet displays messages containing non-printable or binary characters as whitespace in signature request dialogs, masking the true content from users. When a dapp requests message signing through the JavaScript Ethereum API, non-printable characters in the message are rendered as blank spaces rather than being properly encoded or rejected. This prevents users from accurately verifying the content they are signing and creates opportunities for deceptive signature requests.\n\n## Exploit Scenario\nA malicious dapp crafts a signature request containing a message with embedded non-printable characters that appear as whitespace to the user. The displayed message looks benign or incomplete. However, the actual message contains hidden binary data specifying malicious actions or different parameters than what the user perceives. The user, seeing what appears to be a standard or incomplete message, signs the request without realizing they are authorizing something entirely different from what is displayed.\n\n## Recommendations\n- **Short term:** Implement detection of non-printable characters and display messages containing such characters in hex encoding rather than as UTF-8 text.\n- **Long term:** Establish consistent message handling standards that always display both plaintext and hex representations of signature requests, and implement warnings for messages containing non-printable characters to alert users of potentially deceptive content.",
