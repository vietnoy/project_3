    "content": "**Update**\nMarked as \"Acknowledged\" by the client. The client provided the following explanation:\n\n> setCollateralFactor() does not have a name that explicitly reflects its ability to also set the liquidation threshold, but both are co-related, this behavior is documented in the comments, and this design choice was made to align with the Isolated Interface.\n\n**File(s) affected:**`SetterFacet.sol`\n\n**Description:** The functions `setCollateralFactor()` and `__setCollateralFactor()` are not only involved in setting a market's collateral factor, but also in setting its liquidation threshold. Hence, the function should be named differently, so as to avoid user confusion.\n\n**Recommendation:** Consider renaming the function something more accurate and consistent with the rest of the codebase, such as `setLTVFactors()`.",
