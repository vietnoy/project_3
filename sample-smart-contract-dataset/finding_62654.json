    "content": "## Severity: Low Risk\n\n## Context\nWarehouse13.sol#L199-L200\n\n## Description\nThe `initializeSVF` function of the Warehouse13 contract is intended to be called by the contract's owner to initialize the portfolio, checking that the current SVF balance matches 5% of the total supply.\n\n```solidity\nuint256 balance = ERC20(svfToken).balanceOf(address(this));\nif ((totalSupply * 5) / 100 != balance) revert InvalidSVFBalance();\n```\n\nThe strict balance check means that any donation of SVF tokens to the contract prior to the owner calling `initializeSVF` might cause a denial of service, because the balance won't match the expected amount. The likelihood of this occurring depends on the deployment and initialization process of the contract.\n\n## Recommendation\nConsider reviewing the balance check performed during the `initializeSVF` function. One potential solution would involve changing the strict check for a greater-than-or-equal one, which would render any donation attempting to DoS the function pointless.\n\n## Semantic Layer\nAcknowledged. We have two options:\n\n- `==`: This ensures that we have the exact quantity when initializing, preventing us from allocating the wrong number of SVF tokens. Moreover, even if a malicious user donation leads to a DoS, we can still redeploy the contract.\n- `>=`: This is to prevent DoS caused by donation attacks. But I believe attackers have no reason to profit, and no one knows when we will deploy the project.\n\nOverall, I think the possibility of an attack is extremely low. I recommend keeping it strictly equal to `==` to prevent us from allocating the wrong number of SVF tokens. If we use `>=`, then we will still pass if we accidentally allocate too many tokens.\n\n## Spearbit\nAcknowledged.",
