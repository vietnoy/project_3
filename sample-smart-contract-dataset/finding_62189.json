    "content": "\n_Resolved_\n\n\r\nThe `redeem` function in `UsrExternalRequestsManager` lacks a minimum expected amount parameter to protect users from price changes between transaction submission and execution. The redemption rate is determined by the Aave oracle price at execution time. If network congestion causes transaction delays or if there is high price volatility:\r\n- User submits redemption expecting X tokens based on the current price\r\n- Transaction remains pending while price moves unfavorably\r\n- When executed, user receives significantly less than X tokens\r\n- User has no control as there was no minimum amount specified\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n    function redeem(\r\n        uint256 _amount,\r\n        address _receiver,\r\n        address _withdrawalTokenAddress\r\n    ) public whenNotPaused onlyAllowedProviders {\r\n        IERC20(ISSUE_TOKEN_ADDRESS).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);\r\n        usrRedemptionExtension.redeem(_amount, _receiver, _withdrawalTokenAddress);\r\n\r\n        emit Redeemed(msg.sender, _receiver, _amount, _withdrawalTokenAddress);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's recommended to add a `_minExpectedAmount` parameter to the redeem function.\n\n\n\n",
