    "content": "\nSource: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-06-notional-exponent-judging/issues/834 \n\n## Found by \n0xBoraichoT, 0xPhantom2, 0xRstStn, 0xodus, 0xpiken, Hueber, Ragnarok, X0sauce, coffiasd, dan\\_\\_vinci, patitonar, underdog, xiaoming90, y4y\n\n### Summary\n\n`initializeMarket` can be frontran, creating the same morpho market as the expected when initializing. \n\n### Root Cause\n\nIn [MorphoLendingRouter.sol#L51](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-06-notional-exponent/blob/main/notional-v4/src/routers/MorphoLendingRouter.sol#L51), the router will try to initialize a market for a certain market params configuration. Note that `initializeMarket` is the only way to store data for the vault in the corresponding `s_morphoParams` mapping, and it is critical that this mapping is written to, as `marketParams()` wwill [fetch some of the data from the stored mapping(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-06-notional-exponent/blob/main/notional-v4/src/routers/MorphoLendingRouter.sol#L59), and this function is [used across the whole router contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-06-notional-exponent/blob/main/notional-v4/src/routers/MorphoLendingRouter.sol#L77).\n\nThe problem is that anybody can frontrun the initialization by directly calling morpho's `createMarket()` function, creating the same market. After that, the initialization will fail because Morpho [ensures that the same market can only be created once](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBBBBBbbBBb9cC5e90e3b3Af64bdAF62C37EEFFCb#code#F1#L154). Because of this, markets initializations will be dos'ed, and the router won't be usable for the corresponding vault with the desired market params.\n\n### Internal Pre-conditions\n\nNone.\n\n### External Pre-conditions\n\nNone.\n\n### Attack Path\n\n1. `upgradeAdmin` calls `initializeMarket`\n2. Malicious user frontruns the call, calling Morpho's `createMarket` with the same market params as the initialization.\n3. `initializeMarket` fails due to the [check in market creation](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBBBBBbbBBb9cC5e90e3b3Af64bdAF62C37EEFFCb#code).\n\n### Impact\n\nMedium, it is possible to DoS market initialization, which will prevent storing the corresponding market for the given vault, preventing such vault from being used. \n\n### PoC\n\n_No response_\n\n### Mitigation\n\nConsider implementing a `try/catch` statement. If the market creation fails, it will mean the market was already created, allowing configuration to still be performed\n\n\n",
    "summary": "\nThis bug report discusses a potential issue with the `initializeMarket` function in the MorphoLendingRouter contract. This function is critical for storing data and is used throughout the contract. The problem is that anyone can frontrun the initialization process, creating the same market and causing the initialization to fail. This can lead to a denial of service attack, preventing the corresponding vault from being used. A possible solution is to implement a `try/catch` statement to handle this issue.",
