    "content": "\n_Resolved_\n\n## Severity\n\n**Impact:** Medium\n\n**Likelihood:** Medium\n\n## Description\n\nCurrently, the `feeReceiver` address is stored as a state variable within each Vault contract during initialization. It is passed from the Vault Factory at deployment time via the `initializeVault(...)` function:\n\n```solidity\nIVault(vaultInfo[vaultId].addr).initialize(..., feeBps, feeReceiver);\n```\n\nThis design means that if the Factory’s `feeReceiver` address changes later (e.g., due to a governance update or operational reconfiguration), previously deployed Vaults will continue using the outdated address. As a result:\n\n* Fees may be sent to obsolete or incorrect recipients.\n* Fee routing becomes inconsistent across Vaults over time.\n\nThis approach tightly couples fee logic to a single deployment-time value, which undermines centralized or upgradable fee management.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nRather than persisting the `feeReceiver` in each Vault, Vaults should dynamically query the current address from the Factory. This ensures consistent behavior across the protocol. For example:\n\n```solidity\nfunction getFeeReceiver() public view returns (address) {\n    return IVaultFactory(factory).feeReceiver();\n}\n```\n\n\n\n",
