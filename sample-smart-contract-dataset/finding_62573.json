    "content": "\n_Acknowledged_\n\nIn the Card contract, the MINT_MANAGER_ROLE and REDEEM_MANAGER_ROLE are defined as privileged roles for managing card minting and redemption operations, respectively.\n\nHowever, multiple `Cards` could refer to the same `rbac` (Role-Based Access Control) instance via `RoleBasedAccessControlConsumer`. This design implies that if a user is granted minting or redemption privileges in one `Card`, they inherently possess the same privileges in all other `Card` instances that share the same `rbac`.\n\nThis raises concerns about the independence of access control across different `Card` contracts, as it could lead to unintended privilege escalation or management issues if the roles are not intended to be universally applicable.\n\n\n\n",
