    "title": "Missing Cooldown in `DsoRules_CastVote` May Allow SV's to Avoid Removal",
    "content": "**Update**\nMarked as \"Fixed\" by the client. Addressed in: `af17abbeeecac1a445da873f58322e40370253ae`.\n\n**File(s) affected:**`DsoRules.daml`\n\n**Description:**`DsoRules_CastVote` allows any SV party to submit their votes for a `ActionRequiringConfirmation`, and even change their vote later. During this process the `VoteRequest` contract is archived and recreated with an updated list of votes. Since this contract needs to be supplied by the `dsoDelegate` to execute the action, constant archiving could hinder or even entirely avoid execution. One such action is the offboarding of an SV. Circumventing this DoS may then require off-chain collaboration to directly block traffic of the attacking SV.\n\nSimilarly any SV delay could the advancement of `OpenMiningRounds` by repeatedly altering their `AmuletPriceVote`, of which all votes are required to be submitted to `fetchMedianAmuletPrice`. Nonetheless, there are limitations to such an attack. First, SV's have been vetted and approved previously, and can generally be expected to behave in the best interest of the network. Secondly, this form of DoS attack required constant effort, has no full guarantee of success and can merely temporarily delay certain actions. Given these constraints, the issue has been assigned a Low severity.\n\n**Recommendation:** As already pointed out in `TODO(#9319)`, the best solution is the introduction of a rate limiting mechanism for any of these vital updates. For `AmuletPriceVote`, comments suggest that the `lastUpdatedAt` field was already intended to limit update frequency, but this is not yet enforced.",
