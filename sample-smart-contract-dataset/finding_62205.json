    "title": "Malicious user holding `HilBTC` tokens can front run blacklisted transaction",
    "content": "**Description:** When the `blacklister` attempts to blacklist a malicious user holding `HilBTC` tokens, the maliciois user can monitor the memepool and  front-run the blacklist tx by quickly redeeming their `HilBTC` tokens through the `minter` contract before the blacklist takes effect. Once redeemed, the user successfully exits their position with the underlying assets, completely bypassing the intended blacklist enforcement mechanism.\n\n```solidity\nfunction redeem(\n        uint256 amount\n    ) external onlyWhitelisted(msg.sender) nonReentrant {\n        hilBTCToken.burnFrom(msg.sender, amount);\n        baseAsset.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);\n        totalDeposits -= amount;\n        emit Redeemed(msg.sender, amount);\n    }\n\n```\n\nNote that this could not happen in the `StakingVault.sol`\n\n**Impact:** Blacklist can be avoided if  a malicious user front run the blacklisted call\n\n**Proof of Concept:** **Recommended Mitigation:**\n\nConsider add a cooldown also in the `redeem` function of the minter\n\n**Syntetika:**\nAcknowledged; this is generally the case with all blacklisting mechanisms. Protocols can perform these transactions via [services](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-protect/overview) which prevent front-running.\n\nWe don't think it is worth adding extra complexity to the code to deal with this issue, we'll just use a service for running blacklist txns through if this is a real concern. In practice this \"attack vector\" is pretty much never an issue; I'm not aware of a single instance where this attack has occurred.",
