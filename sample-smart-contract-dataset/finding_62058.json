This system involves complex state transitions, financial stakes in the form of bonds, and a multi-layered access-control model. As such, the security and reliability of dependent protocols are critically reliant on the correctness of this logic.\n\nThroughout the repository, there is an absence of a dedicated test suite for the contracts in scope. Without automated tests, there is no formal, repeatable process to verify that the contracts function as intended. Verifying the correctness of the intricate state machine, access-control logic, and financial calculations is left to manual review, which is error-prone and time-consuming. Furthermore, the lack of a regression suite means that future changes to the codebase could inadvertently introduce critical vulnerabilities without being detected.\n\nConsider implementing a comprehensive test suite that covers the functionality of the scoped contracts. This suite should include unit tests for individual functions, integration tests to validate the interactions between contracts, and fork tests to simulate behavior in a realistic on-chain environment. The tests should validate expected outcomes, proper handling of edge cases, and adherence to the access control model. Establishing robust test coverage would significantly improve the maintainability and security posture of the system.\n\n***Update:** Resolved in [pull request #25](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/managed-oracle/pull/25) at commit [31b47fd](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/managed-oracle/pull/25/commits/31b47fd090ee0eb1b201debf31ace1cf99e44d39). Tests for the `ManagedOptimisticOracleV2` contract were added.*",
