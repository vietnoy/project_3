    "content": "## Security Review Summary\n\n## Severity\n**Low Risk**\n\n## Context\n`SystemConfig.sol#L526-L534`\n\n## Description\nIn `SystemConfig.paused()`, the identifier used to check if the chain is paused is determined based on whether the `ETH_LOCKBOX` feature is enabled:\n\n```solidity\nfunction paused() public view returns (bool) {\n    // Determine the appropriate chain identifier based on the feature flags.\n    address identifier = isFeatureEnabled[Features.ETH_LOCKBOX]\n        ? address(IOptimismPortal2(payable(optimismPortal())).ethLockbox())\n        : address(optimismPortal());\n    // Check if either global or local pause is active.\n    return superchainConfig.paused(address(0)) || superchainConfig.paused(identifier);\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this implementation makes it possible to accidentally unpause a chain when enabling/disabling the `ETH_LOCKBOX` feature.\n\nFor example, assume that:\n- A chain currently has `ETH_LOCKBOX` disabled.\n- The chain is currently paused (i.e. the `OptimismPortal2` address is set to paused in `SuperchainConfig`).\n\nIf `ETH_LOCKBOX` is enabled, the chain's pause identifier changes to the `ETHLockbox` address, which isn't set to paused in `SuperchainConfig`. As such, the chain is unpaused without actually calling `unpause()`.\n\n## Recommendation\nA potential solution would be to check if the chain is paused in `setFeature()` and revert. However, note that this removes the ability to disable features while the chain is paused, which might be needed (e.g. in case a feature has a bug).\n\n## Acknowledgements\n- **OP Labs**: Acknowledged. For U16a we are going to address this with better documentation. For U17 we might add some code in the `SystemConfig` to prevent the footgun/be more explicit about this concern.\n- **Spearbit**: Acknowledged.",
