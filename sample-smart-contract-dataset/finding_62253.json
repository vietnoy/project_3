    "content": "## Difficulty: High\n\n## Type: Data Validation\n\n## Description\nThe `op::update_config` privileged operation allows the administrator account to update all configuration parameters for the master contract, including the liquidation threshold value for opened positions.\n\nIt is likely that some EVAA users will not monitor their positions at all times, so a change on the liquidation threshold can affect existing positions, making them partially or completely liquidatable. Users will not be aware of the parameter change, and therefore will be unable to modify their positions to avoid being liquidated.\n\n## Recommendations\n### Short term\nConsider alternatives to give users time to adapt to parameter changes. For example, use a timelock mechanism to update critical protocol parameters, ensuring that there is enough time for existing users to learn about the change, and adjust their positions accordingly.\n\n### Long term\nEnsure that the documentation and website clearly mention these risks to users. Design a communication strategy that can reach as many users as possible to communicate incoming changes.",
