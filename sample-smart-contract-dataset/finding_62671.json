    "content": "##### Description\nThis issue has been identified within the `initialize()`, `setMintFee`, `setRedeemFee`, and `setSwapFee` functions of the `SelfPeggingAsset` contract, and in the `bufferPercent` parameter of the `LPToken` contract.\n\nAlthough each fee is capped individually, the owner can still set all fees close to their maximum, resulting in very high cumulative fees.\n\nThe issue is classified as **low** severity because it does not present an immediate exploit but may create unfavorable conditions for liquidity providers and traders.\n\n##### Recommendation\nWe recommend implementing a combined check so that total fees never exceed a reasonable threshold (for example, 10% for mint/swap/redeem fees and 50% for `bufferPercent`), ensuring fair usage of the protocol.\n",
