    "title": "Individually Changeable `RiskEngine` per `pToken` Leading to Inconsistency",
    "content": "##### Description\nThis issue has been identified in the architecture allowing `riskEngine` to be changed individually for each `pToken`. There is no robust mechanism to ensure a coordinated migration for all `pToken`s simultaneously.\n\nPotential issues include:\n- **Incorrect risk calculations**: Different `RiskEngine`s may use varying collateral or liquidity logic, leading to inconsistent borrow allowances and liquidation criteria.\n- **Inconsistent user state**: If some `pToken`s migrate to a new `RiskEngine` while others remain on the old one, the system may fail to recognize a user’s overall collateral or debt, allowing an overborrow or blocking legitimate actions.\n\nThe issue is classified as **low** severity because it requires a particular combination of conditions (e.g., switching or adding a new `RiskEngine`) to become exploitable, but it can still lead to inconsistent accounting and potential exploits.\n\n##### Recommendation\nWe recommend removing the external `setRiskEngine` function from the `PTokenModule` so that the `RiskEngine` cannot be changed arbitrarily per `pToken`. If a migration is unavoidable, consider making the `RiskEngine` reference immutable within the Beacon implementation to ensure consistency across all `pTokens`.\n",
