    "content": "**Update**\nMarked as \"Fixed\" by the client. Addressed in: `4f527a29b7d13f9748c7ab9d390a29e05d4cadba`. The client provided the following explanation:\n\n> Fix unreachable code warnings in stake amount selection and route utilities\n\n**File(s) affected:**`app/(auth)/(tabs)/stake/select-amount.tsx`, `utils/saucerswap/base/sdk-v3/entities/route.ts`\n\n**Description:** There are portions of the code which are unreachable, or the developers have made wrong assumptions. These are:\n\n*   `/utils/saucerswap/base/sdk-v3/entities/route.ts`, function `constructor`: In line 37, the property `output.wrapped` is accessed, implying that output is not `null` or `undefined`. In line 62, output has the applied nullish coalescing operator, which means that `tokenPath[tokenPath.length - 1]` will never be assigned to `this.output` there.\n\n*   `./app/(auth)/(tabs)/stake/select-amount.tsx`, line 198: `tokenBalance` fields were previously accessed and on this line there is the nullish coalescing operator applied to the field. By that logic, the value `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` would never be assigned.\n\n**Recommendation:** Use static code analyzers or linters to detect dead code areas, and check the assumptions on the two outlined above.",
