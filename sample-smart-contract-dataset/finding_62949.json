    "content": "\n_Resolved_\n\n`VaultFactory.initializeVault()` calls `Vault.initialize()` passing `feeBps` as one of the parameters. This state variable can be changed by the owner, so the creator of the vault might initialize it with a different value than the one expected.\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n- Alice creates a vault and, at that time, the `feeBps` is 100 (1%).\n- Owner changes the `feeBps` to 500 (5%).\n- Alice initializes the vault assuming that a 1% fee will be applied, but in reality, a 5% fee will be applied.\n\nThe following change is suggested to ensure that the `feeBps` expected by the vault creator matches the one set in the factory:\n\n```diff\n  function initializeVault(\n    uint256 vaultId,\n    uint256 fixedSideCapacity,\n    uint256 variableSideCapacity,\n    uint256 duration,\n-   address variableAsset\n+   address variableAsset,\n+   uint256 expectedFeeBps\n  ) public {\n    // Get vault info for the vault we want to initialize and make sure msg.sender is the creator\n    require(vaultInfo[vaultId].creatorAddress == msg.sender, \"CMI\");\n\n+  require(feeBps == expectedFeeBps, \"FEE_MISMATCH\");\n```\n\n\n\n",
