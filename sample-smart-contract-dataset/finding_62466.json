This contract prevents the accidental transfer of ownership to an address that cannot handle it, such as due to a typo, by requiring the recipient of owner permissions to actively accept ownership via a contract call.\n\n## Location of Affected Code\n\nFile: [BlueBeraToken.sol](https://github.com/BeraRoot2025/bluebera-contracts/blob/5e2c5f14717718d7b4dc32729853f0c945ec3bb8/contracts/BlueBeraToken.sol)\nFile: [LinearVesting.sol](https://github.com/BeraRoot2025/bluebera-contracts/blob/5e2c5f14717718d7b4dc32729853f0c945ec3bb8/contracts/LinearVesting.sol)\nFile: [AirdropDistributor.sol](https://github.com/BeraRoot2025/bluebera-contracts/blob/5e2c5f14717718d7b4dc32729853f0c945ec3bb8/contracts/AirdropDistributor.sol)\nFile: [StakingRewards.sol](https://github.com/BeraRoot2025/bluebera-contracts/blob/5e2c5f14717718d7b4dc32729853f0c945ec3bb8/contracts/StakingRewards.sol)\n\n## Recommendation\n\nConsider using `Ownable2Step` from OpenZeppelin Contracts\n\n## Team Response\n\nAcknowledged.\n\n",
