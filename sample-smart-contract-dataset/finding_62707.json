    "content": "##### Description\nThis issue has been identified due to the shared use of the same storage address (`_SLOT_PTOKEN_STORAGE`) for both transient reentrancy guard data and persistent protocol data. While currently functional, any future refactoring that merges these two data sets into a single storage layout may cause overlap of the reentrancy guard flag with other state variables, leading to unpredictable or corrupted behavior.\n\n##### Recommendation\nAs a precautionary measure, we recommend assigning a dedicated storage slot for the reentrancy guard flag to ensure clear separation from other storage variables. This isolation helps protect against unintentional overlap during upgrades or refactoring.\n",
