    "content": "## Severity: Medium Risk\n\n## Context\nutil.cpp#L37\n\n## Description\n`monad::async::working_temporary_directory` casts away the constness of `std::string::c_str()` and modifies it via `mkostemp`:\n\n```cpp\nauto path2 = path / \"monad_XXXXXX\";\nfd = mkostemp(const_cast<char *>(path2.native().c_str()), O_DIRECT);\n```\n\n`monad::async::make_temporary_inode` does the same via `mkstemp`:\n\n```cpp\nauto buffer = working_temporary_directory() / \"monad_XXXXXX\";\nfd = mkstemp(const_cast<char *>(buffer.native().c_str()));\n```\n\nIt is legal to remove constness from a const object or pointer using `const_cast`, but it is undefined behavior to subsequently modify the contents of the const-removed object.\n\nFrom [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/const_cast.html):\n> Modifying a const object through a non-const access path and referring to a volatile object through a non-volatile glvalue results in undefined behavior.\n\nFor `std::string::c_str()` specifically, cppreference repeats the UB condition:\n[cppreference on c_str()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/c_str.html):\n> Writing to the character array accessed through `c_str()` is undefined behavior.\n\nApart from the general undefined behavior, `std::string` is at liberty to allocate and return a copy of the underlying string when `c_str()` is invoked. Hence, any changes made to it might not affect the `std::filesystem::path` that the code aims to modify.\n\n## Recommendation\nApply modifications only to a non-const `std::string` via its `data()` method and, as needed, reconstruct a `std::filesystem::path` object from the result.\n\n## Category Labs\nFixed in PR 1587.\n\n## Spearbit\nFix verified.",
    "summary": "\nThe bug report discusses a problem in the code related to constness in `util.cpp` file. The code uses `const_cast` to modify the contents of a const object, which is considered undefined behavior. This can result in unexpected changes and can cause the code to break. The report recommends using the `data()` method instead of `c_str()` to make modifications and reconstruct the object if needed. The bug has been fixed in a pull request and verified by the team.",
