The client provided the following explanation:\n\n> This suggestion didn't involve immediate action but it has been noted for the deployment process.\n\n**Description:** The `releaseTokens()` function transfers the tokens from the `gnosisSafe` (who originally got all the token supply) to the `schedule.safe` address which originally was set as the same `gnosisSafe`. This could lead to the contract and the original receiving team thinking that a vesting was succesfully released when the original owner of the token still has them.\n\n**Recommendation:** Avoid minting the tokens beforehand and only mint when it is needed.",
