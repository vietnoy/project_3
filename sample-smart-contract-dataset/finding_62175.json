    "content": "\n_Acknowledged_\n\nThe `EulerEarn.maxWithdraw()` function is designed to return the maximum amount of the underlying asset that can be withdrawn from the owner's balance in the vault, through a withdraw call. this function first accrues fees via `_accruedFeeAndAssets()`, then calculates the withdrawable assets by calling `balanceOf(owner)` and converting the resulting shares to assets.\nHowever, if the `owner` is the `feeRecipient`, their unclaimed `feeShares` are not reflected in their balance, leading to an underestimation of the actual amount they can withdraw.\n\nThis discrepancy arises because `feeShares` are tracked separately and not included in `balanceOf(feeRecipient)`, even though they represent valid claimable shares.\n\n```solidity\n   function _maxWithdraw(\n        address owner\n    )\n        internal\n        view\n        returns (uint256 assets, uint256 newTotalSupply, uint256 newTotalAssets)\n    {\n        uint256 feeShares;\n        (feeShares, newTotalAssets, ) = _accruedFeeAndAssets();\n        newTotalSupply = totalSupply() + feeShares;\n\n        assets = _convertToAssetsWithTotals(\n            balanceOf(owner),\n            newTotalSupply,\n            newTotalAssets,\n            Math.Rounding.Floor\n        );\n        assets -= _simulateWithdrawStrategy(assets);\n    }\n```\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n\nConsider updating the logic to account for `feeShares` when `owner == feeRecipient` by including them in the total shares used for the conversion to assets.\n\n### Euler comments\n\nWe acknownledge the finding, will keep as is.\n\nNote balanceOf(feeRecipient) will also under-report because it doesn't calculate fees.\n\n\n\n",
