    "content": "\nSource: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-06-notional-exponent-judging/issues/320 \n\n## Found by \nmstpr-brainbot\n\n### Summary\n\nIn single-sided yield strategies, both underlying tokens of the pool have infinite allowance set on the pool contract. When a user chooses to withdraw, they can withdraw with both tokens and then sell the underlying tokens for the \"asset\".\n\nIf the user selects **CURVE\\_V2** and sets the swap pool to be the **same pool** that the strategy is currently LP'ing into, then the `TRADING_MODULE` will **revoke the token allowances (set to 0)** for security. This breaks the strategy, as it will no longer have the required token allowance to deposit into the yield strategy, effectively making deposits impossible.\n\n\n### Root Cause\n\nLet's go through an example with explanations. Assume the yield strategy's yield token is the Convex crvUSD-USDC LP token and the asset is USDC.\n\nFirst, when the strategy is deployed, both USDC and crvUSD will be infinitely approved to the pool to mint LP tokens:\n[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-06-notional-exponent/blob/82c87105f6b32bb362d7523356f235b5b07509f9/notional-v4/src/single-sided-lp/CurveConvex2Token.sol#L169-L178](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-06-notional-exponent/blob/82c87105f6b32bb362d7523356f235b5b07509f9/notional-v4/src/single-sided-lp/CurveConvex2Token.sol#L169-L178)\n\nNow, say Alice comes and wants to withdraw her shares double-sided to crvUSD and USDC and then sells the USDC for crvUSD in the same pool:\n[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-06-notional-exponent/blob/82c87105f6b32bb362d7523356f235b5b07509f9/notional-v4/src/single-sided-lp/AbstractSingleSidedLP.sol#L163-L178](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-06-notional-exponent/blob/82c87105f6b32bb362d7523356f235b5b07509f9/notional-v4/src/single-sided-lp/AbstractSingleSidedLP.sol#L163-L178)\n\nAs we can see, the tokens received will be sold to the \"asset\" token, and since the asset is USDC, the USDC withdrawn from the LP will be skipped and only crvUSD will be sold to USDC:\n[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-06-notional-exponent/blob/82c87105f6b32bb362d7523356f235b5b07509f9/notional-v4/src/single-sided-lp/AbstractSingleSidedLP.sol#L223-L251](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-06-notional-exponent/blob/82c87105f6b32bb362d7523356f235b5b07509f9/notional-v4/src/single-sided-lp/AbstractSingleSidedLP.sol#L223-L251)\n\nHowever, as we can see above, `dexId` is not forced. The user can pick CURVE\\_V2 and set the pool to be the same pool the strategy is depositing into:\n[https://github.com/notional-finance/leveraged-vaults/blob/7e0abc3e118db0abb20c7521c6f53f1762fdf562/contracts/trading/adapters/CurveV2Adapter.sol#L42-L63](https://github.com/notional-finance/leveraged-vaults/blob/7e0abc3e118db0abb20c7521c6f53f1762fdf562/contracts/trading/adapters/CurveV2Adapter.sol#L42-L63)\n\nIf that's the case, crvUSD will be swapped to USDC in the same pool, and after the `TRADING_MODULE` finishes swapping, it revokes the allowance of the `sellToken`, which in this case is USDC:\n[https://github.com/notional-finance/leveraged-vaults/blob/7e0abc3e118db0abb20c7521c6f53f1762fdf562/contracts/trading/TradingUtils.sol#L54-L57](https://github.com/notional-finance/leveraged-vaults/blob/7e0abc3e118db0abb20c7521c6f53f1762fdf562/contracts/trading/TradingUtils.sol#L54-L57)\n\nNow, the user will receive their USDC and a successful withdrawal but what happened is that the yield strategy now has **zero** allowance on the yield token (the Curve pool), which means **no user can deposit into the strategy anymore**. It’s permanently blocked because the strategy is always expected to have infinite allowance, but now has none.\n\n\n### Internal Pre-conditions\n\n1. \"asset\" token is one of the curve lp tokens (very possible)\n\n\n### External Pre-conditions\n\nNone needed\n\n### Attack Path\n\n1. Exit position double sided with redemption trade using the same curve pool\n\n### Impact\n\nStrategy deposits are permanently blocked due to lack of allowance for \"asset\" token to pool. \n\n### PoC\n\n_No response_\n\n### Mitigation\n\nDo not allow CURVE_V2 if \"asset\" token trade.pool is the same. For CURVE_V2 multiple swaps it could be a problem to check each pool but I guess thats not the case since the router has the one doing the swaps not the strategy. \n\n",
    "summary": "\nThis bug report describes an issue found by a user named mstpr-brainbot in a yield strategy where both underlying tokens of the pool have infinite allowance set on the pool contract. This allows users to withdraw both tokens and sell them for the \"asset\" token. However, if the user selects the same pool as the strategy is currently LP'ing into, the token allowances will be revoked, breaking the strategy and making deposits impossible. This is due to a lack of allowance for the \"asset\" token to the pool. The impact of this bug is that strategy deposits are permanently blocked and a fix is recommended to not allow the same pool to be used for both the strategy and the redemption trade. ",
