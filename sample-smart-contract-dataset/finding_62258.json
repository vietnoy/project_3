    "content": "## Severity: Medium Risk\n\n**Context:** (No context files were provided by the reviewer)\n\n## Summary\nThe `lock()` function intends to lock the user's entire approved balance, but this will fail for the most common case: Most users give the contract's they interact with an unlimited allowance by setting it to `type(uint256).max`. The `lock()` function attempts to transfer this amount to itself, which is bound to fail.\n\n## Finding Description\nThe `LockManagerBase` contract has two `lock()` functions, both intended to lock a balance of tokens into the contract. One variant of these functions does not require the specification of a specific amount; instead, it assumes that the user wants to lock all of the tokens that have been approved to the contract according to `_incomingTokenBalance()`.\n\nThe `LockManagerERC20` contract implements `_incomingTokenBalance()` by simply returning the current allowance given by the user. However, for ERC20 tokens, the most commonly given allowance is the \"unlimited\" one, represented by setting it to `type(uint256).max`. This does not accurately represent the actual incoming token balance and will cause the `transferFrom()` call to fail.\n\n## Recommendation\nHave the `_incomingTokenBalance()` return either the actual balance or the allowance depending on whichever is smallest.\n\n```solidity\nfunction _incomingTokenBalance() internal view virtual override returns (uint256) {\n    // Original line\n    // return erc20Token.allowance(msg.sender, address(this));\n    \n    uint256 allowance = erc20Token.allowance(msg.sender, address(this));\n    uint256 balance = erc20Token.balanceOf(msg.sender);\n    return (allowance >= balance) ? balance : allowance;\n}\n```\n\n**Aragon:** Fixed in PR 31.  \n**Spearbit:** Fix verified.",
    "summary": "\nThis bug report discusses an issue with the `lock()` function in the `LockManagerBase` contract. The function is intended to lock a user's entire approved balance, but it fails to do so in the most common case. This is because most users give the contract an unlimited allowance, which causes the `transferFrom()` call to fail. The recommendation is to have the `_incomingTokenBalance()` function return either the actual balance or the allowance, whichever is smaller. The bug has been fixed in the code and verified by the team.",
