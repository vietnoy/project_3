    "title": "Potential DOS via External Token Transfer Affecting `assert` Checks",
    "content": "##### Description\nThis issue has been identified in multiple locations (`zapIn`, `zapOut`, and `zapOutSingle`) within the `Zap` contract. \nSpecifically, an `assert` statement checks that the contract holds zero tokens after an operation. If an attacker (or any user) transfers even a minimal amount (e.g., 1 wei) of the same token directly to the contract, the `assert` can fail and revert the transaction, causing a potential Denial of Service (DOS).\n\nAdditionally, while appropriate for internal invariants, `assert` should generally not be used for flow control. `assert` reverts consume all remaining gas and convey less explicit error messaging compared to `require`.\n\nThe issue is classified as **medium** severity because it can disrupt normal contract usage by reverting user operations if the contract’s token balance unexpectedly becomes non-zero.\n##### Recommendation\nWe recommend removing these `assert` statements.\n",
    "summary": "\nThe `Zap` contract has a bug in multiple locations, specifically in the `zapIn`, `zapOut`, and `zapOutSingle` functions. The bug is caused by an `assert` statement that checks for zero tokens after an operation. If a small amount of tokens (even just 1 wei) is transferred directly to the contract, the `assert` can fail and cause a potential Denial of Service (DOS) attack. It is recommended to remove these `assert` statements to prevent disruption of normal contract usage and to use `require` instead for better error messaging. This bug is considered to be of medium severity.",
