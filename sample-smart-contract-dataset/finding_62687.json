    "title": "Volatility Fee Ratio Calculated from The Wrong Denominator",
    "content": "##### Description\nThis issue has been identified within the `_updateMultiplierForToken` function of the `SelfPeggingAsset` contract.\n\nThe contract calculates the volatility ratio as follows:\n```solidity\nuint256 ratio = (diff * FEE_DENOMINATOR) / oldRate;\n```\nwhere `diff = |newRate – oldRate|`. The ratio is incorrectly calculated using only the `oldRate` as a denominator, regardless of whether the rate has increased or decreased. Specifically, when the rate increases significantly, dividing by the smaller `oldRate` artificially inflates the ratio.\n\nFor example, if the rate triples from 1 to 3, the correct ratio should be:\n\n```\n(3 - 1) / 3 ≈ 0.66\n```\n\nHowever, the current code calculates it as:\n\n```\n(3 - 1) / 1 = 2\n```\n\nThis results in an exaggerated volatility fee, unfairly increasing costs for users after upward rate movements.\n\nThe issue is classified as *low* severity as it does not critically affect protocol operations but results in slightly inflated fees during specific rate movements.\n\n##### Recommendation\nWe recommend computing the volatility ratio using the higher of the two rates:\n\n```solidity\nuint256 ratio = (diff * FEE_DENOMINATOR) / max(oldRate, newRate);\n```\n",
