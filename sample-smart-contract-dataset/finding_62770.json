    "title": "[L-10] Lack of minimum redemption causes spam for `ORDER_FILLER_ROLE`",
    "content": "\n_Resolved_\n\nCurrently in the `createRedeemOrder` function in `YuzuOrderBook`, there is a check to ensure that not more than `maxTokens` are being redeemed. But there is no such check for the minimum amount on withdrawals. Users are allowed to withdraw as little as 1 wei. This would allow spammers to create multiple `createRedeemOrder` transactions with extremely small token amounts for redemption. This is a problem because these created redeem orders are supposed to be fulfilled by the `ORDER_FILLER_ROLE`, who would call the `fillRedeemOrder` function to fulfil these orders. As the orders are very small, the `ORDER_FILLER_ROLE` could spend more on gas than the order amount being fulfilled, especially on a chain like Ethereum. Hence, this results in gas waste for the `ORDER_FILLER_ROLE`. Also, this would cause unnecessary delays for other redeem orders to be processed.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nAdd a minimum amount for redemptions. Any amount lower than this should not be allowed to be redeemed via `createRedeemOrder`.\n\n\n\n",
