    "title": "`PriceStorage::setPrice` maximum lower and upper bounds can be easily bypassed by repeatedly calling the function in the same block",
    "content": "**Description:** `PriceStorage::setPrice` limits the price movement to a maximum lower/upper range delta based on the current price, to prevent sudden extreme changes in price:\n```solidity\nuint256 lastPriceValue = lastPrice.price;\nif (lastPriceValue != 0) {\n  uint256 upperBound = lastPriceValue + ((lastPriceValue * upperBoundPercentage) / BOUND_PERCENTAGE_DENOMINATOR);\n  uint256 lowerBound = lastPriceValue - ((lastPriceValue * lowerBoundPercentage) / BOUND_PERCENTAGE_DENOMINATOR);\n  if (_price > upperBound || _price < lowerBound) {\n    revert InvalidPriceRange(_price, lowerBound, upperBound);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBut this can be easily bypassed by repeatedly calling the `setPrice` function multiple times in the same block, each time decreasing or increasing the `lastPrice` by the current maximum allowed lower/upper bound.\n\n**Impact:** The limitation of wild price fluctuations can be trivially bypassed so is ineffective, though only by entities having `SERVICE_ROLE`.\n\n**Recommended Mitigation:** Add a configurable parameter `minPriceUpdateDelay` to the`PriceStorage` contract which only `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` can change. Then in `setPrice`:\n```solidity\nerror PriceUpdateTooSoon(uint256 lastUpdate, uint256 minWaitTime);\n\n// In setPrice:\nif(lastPrice.timestamp != 0) {\n    if(block.timestamp < lastPrice.timestamp + minPriceUpdateDelay) {\n        revert PriceUpdateTooSoon(lastPrice.timestamp, minPriceUpdateDelay);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Avant:**\nAcknowledged: the suggestion is valid, and we might consider the change in the future if we automate price setting. Currently, the price is calculated manually after a careful NAV process conducted weekly and will most likely be outsourced to an independent party for increased transparency. Once calculated, the price update transaction is also posted manually and requires a quorum of approvals before being submitted on-chain. This setup ensures that no repeated calls or incorrect parameters are ever attempted, and for now, the current code constraints suit our requirements.",
