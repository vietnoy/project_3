    "title": "[MNBD1-2] Lack of Slippage Protection During Graduation in BondingCurvePool",
    "content": "**Severity:** Medium\n\n**Path:** contracts/BondingCurvePool.sol#L253-L260 \n\n**Description:** When the `BondingCurvePool` has sold all its tokens, it calls `graduateToken` and sends all collected Ether to the Zealous Swap Router to convert it into liquidity. However, it lacks any checks to ensure a fair amount of liquidity is received.\n```\nIZealousSwapRouter02(zealousSwapRouter).addLiquidityKAS{ value: kasCollected }(\n  token,\n  tokenForLiquidity,\n  0,\n  0,\n  address(this),\n  block.timestamp + 15 minutes\n);\n```\nThis makes it vulnerable to sandwich attacks from other users. A user could watch the BondingCurvePool, buy the last tokens to trigger graduation, and then front-run this transaction with another transaction to exploit the lack of slippage (eg: create a pool with server imbalance reserves).\n\n**Remediation:**  To enhance safety, consider setting minimum thresholds for `amountTokenMin` and `amountKASMin`. If the protocol enforces that the `ZealousSwapPair` can only be created after the token has graduated, these minimums can be set to `tokenForLiquidity` and `kasCollected`, respectively.\n\n**Status:**   Fixed\n\n\n- - -",
    "summary": "\nThis bug report discusses a vulnerability in the `BondingCurvePool` contract which can be exploited by malicious users. When the contract sells all its tokens, it calls `graduateToken` and sends all collected Ether to the Zealous Swap Router to convert it into liquidity. However, it does not have any checks in place to ensure a fair amount of liquidity is received. This makes it susceptible to sandwich attacks, where a user can buy the last tokens and front-run the transaction to exploit the lack of slippage. To fix this issue, the report suggests setting minimum thresholds for `amountTokenMin` and `amountKASMin` to ensure a fair amount of liquidity is received. This bug has been fixed.",
