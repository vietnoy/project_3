    "summary": "\nThis bug report discusses an issue with the Malda Protocol, specifically with the support for certain assets. The report was found by two users, 10ap17 and holtzzx. The root cause of the issue is that two platforms, Across and Everclear, do not fully support all of the assets that are listed as supported. This results in the inability to rebalance markets for those specific tokens. There are no specific attack paths identified, but the impact is that rebalancing will be impossible for those markets. The report does not include a Proof of Concept or any suggested mitigation strategies. However, the protocol team has fixed the issue in a recent pull request on GitHub. ",
