    "content": "\n_Acknowledged_\n\nIn the `SpinLottery` contract, if there are insufficient prizes available, the `_claimPrize` function will revert with the error `NoPrizesAvailable`.\n\n```solidity\n        PrizePool storage pool = prizePools[rarity];\n        if (pool.nextPrizeId <= pool.firstPrizeId) revert NoPrizesAvailable();        \n```\n\nThis error can be caught in the try-catch block during the prize distribution process, but it leads to a situation where the user is informed that they did not win.\n\n```solidity\n            // Step 3: Prize Selection\n            try this._distributePrize(req.player, requestId, rarity, prizeRandom) {\n                // Prize distributed successfully\n            } catch {\n                // If prize distribution fails, emit a no-win event\n                emit NoWin(req.player, requestId);\n            }\n```\n\n**This handling is illogical, as the user has fulfilled their obligation by paying, and any failure in the prize distribution should not be attributed to them.** This could result in user dissatisfaction and a perception that the protocol is unfair, as they are effectively penalized for a failure that is not their fault.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nTo improve the error handling, introduce a separate event for cases where there are no prizes available, allowing the contract to **differentiate between a successful spin with no win and a failure due to insufficient prizes.**\n\n\n\n",
