    "content": "\n_Resolved_\n\nThe `setCardAllocationPool` function in the Packet contract allows the `SUPER_ADMIN_ROLE` to change the `randomAllocationPool` address at any time.\n\n```solidity\n    function setCardAllocationPool(address newCardAllocationPool) external onlyRole(SUPER_ADMIN_ROLE) {\n        randomAllocationPool = CardAllocationPool(newCardAllocationPool);\n    }\n```\nThis mid-transaction modification can lead to significant issues:\n- First, users may see outdated pool information on the front end that does not match the actual state during transaction execution, potentially leading to disputes and confusion.\n- Second, if the previous pool address's  `ALLOCATION_MANAGER_ROLE` has also been revoked, any subsequent calls to `finalizeOpen` by the previous pool could fail. This failure would result in the packet being temporarily locked, requiring an administrator to manually call `revertBurnRequest` to resolve the situation.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, consider implementing a mechanism that prevents changes to the `randomAllocationPool` during active transactions or requires a confirmation period before the change takes effect.\n\n\n\n",
