    "content": "**Severity:** Low\n\n**Path:** core/state_transition.go:TransitionDb()\n\n**Description:** Function `TransitionDb()` will transition the state by applying the current message and returning the evm execution result. During the execution of the `TransitionDb()`, activity scores are logged before and after refunds. Since function `TransitionDb()` will be called during the execution of any transaction, logging will also occur during any transaction, which can significantly slow down the blockchain as a whole.  \n```\nfunc (st *StateTransition) TransitionDb() (*ExecutionResult, error) {\n    [...]\n    \n    for _, act := range st.state.GetCurrentActivities() {\n        log.Debug(\"Activities before refund\", \"address\", act.Address, \"activity\", act.Activity, \"delta\", act.DeltaActivity) // @note logs in for loops\n    }\n\n    [...]\n    \n    for _, act := range st.state.GetCurrentActivities() {\n        log.Debug(\"Activities after refund\", \"address\", act.Address, \"activity\", act.Activity, \"delta\", act.DeltaActivity)\n    }\n\n    [...]\n}\n```\n\n**Remediation:**  We would suggest implementing the logging logic, in which only those `activity` parameters that were changed during the transaction will be included in the logs.\n\n**Status:** Fixed\n\n\n- - -",
