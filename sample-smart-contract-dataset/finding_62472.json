    "title": "[M-02] Late participation advantage in `MemePredictionMarket`",
    "content": "\n_Resolved_\n\n## Severity\n\n**Impact:** Medium\n\n**Likelihood:** Medium\n\n## Description\n\nThe current design of MemePredictionMarket allows users to make predictions for most of the round's duration (e.g., a 24-hour round with prediction open for 23 hours), which unintentionally benefits late participants. These users can observe more price action and make better-informed decisions than early participants, leading to an unfair advantage.\n\nExample scenario:\n\n- At the beginning of the round, the token price is 10.\n- A user joins early and makes a prediction.\n- Near the deadline (e.g., hour 23), the price rises to 15.\n- A new user sees this trend and makes the same bullish prediction, with a much higher confidence of winning.\n\nThis system disproportionately rewards those who join late, potentially disincentivizing early participation and harming the fairness of the prediction market.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nImplement time-based weighting: Earlier predictions could receive higher weight or rewards to compensate for increased uncertainty.\n\nincorporate price delta-based weighting: If a user joins after a significant price movement (e.g., from 10 to 20), their prediction reward could be adjusted based on the reduced risk taken.\n\n\n\n",
    "summary": "\nThe MemePredictionMarket has a bug where late participants have an unfair advantage over early participants. This is because they can observe more price action and make better predictions, leading to a disproportionate reward for late joiners. To fix this, the report recommends implementing time-based weighting or incorporating price delta-based weighting to compensate for the increased uncertainty and risk for early participants.",
