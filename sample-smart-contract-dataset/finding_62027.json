    "content": "**Update**\nMarked as \"Fixed\" by the client. Addressed in: `737af6c63b0eae0af9c80425eb8a27afffd14ad8`, `cf36a2fac54e84904c51f8d419c04e215c7b35da` and `24e56c21d8cabbaf5b6236080265d629361e182e`.\n\n**File(s) affected:**`SapienVault.sol`, `SapienQA.sol`\n\n**Description:** Typical unstaking within the protocol requires a two day cooldown period to pass before unstaking can be completed. The intention of this is to allow a sufficient window for any QA penalties to be applied before the user can unstake their tokens. However, in the case of the `earlyUnstake()` function, users are able to instantly withdraw their funds by paying a 20 percent penalty. In cases where a user is expecting to be slashed a value greater than 20 percent they can call the `earlyUnstake()` function to immediately withdraw their tokens and avoid the impending larger QA penalty.\n\n**Recommendation:** Consider enforcing a cooldown period on all unstaking actions to ensure that QA penalties cannot be avoided.",
    "summary": "\nThe client has reported a bug in the SapienVault and SapienQA files. The bug allows users to instantly withdraw their tokens without waiting for the two day cooldown period, by using the `earlyUnstake()` function and paying a 20 percent penalty. This allows users to avoid larger QA penalties, which defeats the purpose of the cooldown period. The client recommends enforcing a cooldown period on all unstaking actions to prevent users from avoiding QA penalties. The bug has been fixed and the issue is now closed.",
