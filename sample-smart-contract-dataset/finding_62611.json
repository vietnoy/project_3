    "content": "\n_Resolved_\n\nPrizes for a rarity pool can be added using `addPrize()` and currently there is no upper limit to the prizes that can be added for a rarity pool , due to this the function `configureRarity()` might go out of gas when it tries to transfer the prize NFTs in the rarity pool to the msg.sender  , meaning rarity pools configuration would fail when needed , this functionality is crucial to the system to de-activate/activate rarities and to transfer out NFTs stuck in the contract due to failed transfers.\n\nRecommendation:\nHave a safe upper limit on how many NFT prizes max can be added to a rarity pool.\n\n\n\n",
