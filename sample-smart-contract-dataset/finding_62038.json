Addressed in: `f99f1d2ce37b2710534182bb2166b648dbb14d5c`. The client provided the following explanation:\n\n> The vulnerability was fixed by implementing the missing pause() and unpause() functions in the Rewards contract.\n\n**File(s) affected:**`Rewards.sol`\n\n**Description:** The `Rewards` contract inherits from `PausableUpgradeable` and includes pause checks in critical functions, but does not implement the actual `pause()` and `unpause()` functions. This means the contract cannot be paused in case of an emergency, despite functions being marked with `whenNotPaused` modifier.\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement pause functionality by adding the `pause()` and `unpause()` functions.",
    "summary": "\nThe client has reported a bug in the `Rewards` contract, which is used in the `PausableUpgradeable` contract. The bug prevents the contract from being paused in case of an emergency, even though it includes checks for pausing in critical functions. The client has recommended implementing the `pause()` and `unpause()` functions to address this issue. The bug has been marked as \"Fixed\" by the client and the fix can be found in the code `f99f1d2ce37b2710534182bb2166b648dbb14d5c`.",
