    "content": "\n_Acknowledged_\n\nThe `EulerEarn` contract does not provide users with slippage protection or deadline enforcement in the `deposit()`, `mint()`, `withdraw()`, and `redeem()` functions. These functions interact with multiple ERC4626-compliant strategy vaults, and users’ assets may be distributed across or pulled from different strategy vaults based on available capacity.\n\nKey concerns:\n\n- **Slippage risk**: During deposits or mints, assets may be split across multiple strategy vaults with varying share prices. During withdrawals or redemptions, the strategy vaults are accessed in a fixed order, and varying liquidity or share price can cause users to receive fewer shares or assets than expected.\n\n- **No deadline enforcement**: If transactions get stuck in the mempool (e.g., during high network congestion), users may be exposed to more significant price movements before execution, further increasing slippage risks.\n\nThis lack of user-defined controls exposes depositors and withdrawers to unfavorable outcomes due to timing and price variations in the underlying vaults.\n\nRecommendation:  \nIntroduce parameters such as `minShares`(`maxShares`) and `minAssets` (`maxAssets`), along with an optional `deadline` field, to allow users to enforce minimum acceptable output and time bounds for their transactions.\n\n### Euler comments\n\nWe acknowledge the finding, will keep as is.\n\n\n\n",
