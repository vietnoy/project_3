    "content": "## Security Analysis Report\n\n## Severity\n**Low Risk**\n\n## Context\n`LockToVotePlugin.sol#L79`\n\n## Description\nThe current implementation of the `LockToVotePlugin` allows the caller to create proposals that do not contain any actions. If the proposal passes and it is executed, the `PluginUUPSUPgradeable._execute` function will invoke `IExecutor.execute(bytes32 _callId, Action[] memory _actions, uint256 _allowFailureMap)` in call or delegatecall mode (see `PluginUUPSUpgradeable.sol#L171-L216`). As far as we can see, there's no point in allowing the creation of a proposal that will possibly lock the user's tokens for no real reason.\n\n## Recommendation\nAragon should revert the `createProposal` function when `_actions.length == 0`.\n\n## Client Acknowledgment\nThe client has acknowledged the issue with the following statement:\n\n**Aragon**: Some DAOs use governance plugins to get feedback from the community by creating \"signaling\" proposals. This is a way for protocol teams, curators, etc., to do a temperature check before committing to a specific, binding set of actions to submit. We acknowledge the risk of a user locking tokens to vote on a signaling proposal with LockToVote.\n\n**Spearbit**: Acknowledged.",
