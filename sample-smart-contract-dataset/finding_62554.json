    "summary": "\nThe bug report is about a missing feature in SpinLottery, which allows users to spin and win one prize NFT. The problem is that there is no way for users to withdraw the spin cost fees that they have paid. These fees are currently locked in the contract and cannot be accessed by the users. The report recommends adding an interface for users to withdraw their spin cost fees.",
