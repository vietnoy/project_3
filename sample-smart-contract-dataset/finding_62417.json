    "title": "[EIGEN2-15] Ejection timestamp is not updated when operator is kicked out in update loop",
    "content": "**Severity:** Low\n\n**Description:** An operator could be kicked by ejection, which invokes the kick functions in `SlashingRegistryCoordinator.sol` It sets a `lastEjectionTimestamp` to the current block.timestamp, which disallows the same operator to register immediately again.\n```\nfunction ejectOperator(\n    address operator,\n    bytes memory quorumNumbers\n) public virtual onlyEjector {\n    lastEjectionTimestamp[operator] = block.timestamp;\n    _kickOperator(operator, quorumNumbers);\n}\n```\nHowever `_kickOperator` is also called when a operator gets kicked by someone registering with churn and during `updateOperators` that kicks operators that don't meet the minimum threshold.\n```\nfunction _updateOperatorsStakes(... ) internal virtual {\n      -- snip\n      if (doesNotMeetStakeThreshold[j]) {\n          _kickOperator(operators[j], singleQuorumNumber);\n      }\n  }\n}\n```\nIt doesn’t update the `lastEjectionTimestamp`, although they are kicked out by not having enough threshold. \n```\nfunction ejectOperator(\n    address operator,\n    bytes memory quorumNumbers\n) public virtual onlyEjector {\n    lastEjectionTimestamp[operator] = block.timestamp;\n    _kickOperator(operator, quorumNumbers);\n}\n```\n\n\n**Remediation:**  Consider updating the operator’s `lastEjectionTimestamp` when they are kicked out for not having a minimum threshold, so they can’t register immediately again.\n\n**Status:** Acknowledged\n\n\n- - -",
