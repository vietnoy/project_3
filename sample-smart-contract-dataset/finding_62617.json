    "content": "\n_Resolved_\n\nIn the `MarketplaceAdmin.sol` contract, the `updateAcceptedCurrency()` function attempts to collect pending fees before updating the payment token.\n\nThe issue occurs when the fee collection silently fails (e.g., if the `feeReceiver` is blacklisted or the token contract is paused), but the currency update succeeds. In this case:\n\n- The `totalPendingFees` in `Marketplace.sol` is not reset to zero.\n- New fees collected in the new token will be added to this same counter.\n- This results in mixing accounting for two different tokens in a single variable.\n\nThis becomes particularly problematic when the two tokens have different decimals (e.g., USDC with 6 decimals and WETH with 18 decimals), the admin doesn't notice the issue early, and users continue paying fees in the new token. When `collectFees()` is called again, it will attempt to transfer the combined amount in only the new token, eventually leading to incorrect fee withdrawals or failed transactions.\n\nRecommendations:\nModify the `updateAcceptedCurrency()` function to use a more robust pattern for fee collection.\n\n\n\n",
