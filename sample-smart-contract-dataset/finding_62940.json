    "content": "## Vulnerability Report\n\n## Severity\n**Low Risk**\n\n## Context\nMorphoMarketV1Adapter.sol#L74\n\n## Description\nIn some cases when the `IMorpho(morpho).supply(...)` is called, 0 shares could be minted for the MorphoMarketV1Adapter. Thus, in these cases, the assets provided would get donated to Morpho.\n\n## Recommendation\nUse the returned values from `IMorpho(morpho).supply(...)` to ensure that there are non-zero shares minted.\n\n## Morpho\nAcknowledged. There is this comment already:\n\n```solidity\n/// @dev This adapter must be used with Morpho Market v1 that are protected against inflation attacks\n/// with an initial supply.\n```\n\nFollowing resource is relevant: [OpenZeppelin Documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/erc4626#inflation-attack).\n\nAnd note that preventing minting zero shares is not enough; you can lose as much but still mint one share (etc...).\n\n## Spearbit\nAcknowledged.",
