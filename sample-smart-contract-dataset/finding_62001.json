    "title": "Missing Error Handling for Asynchronous Function Calls",
    "content": "**Update**\nMarked as \"Fixed\" by the client. Addressed in: `867cf5149e7bacd762596ecd31844318e524a468` The client provided the following explanation:\n\n> Wraped onSettled loop to fetch transactions in try/catch block Comprehensive lifecycle error handling already exists within Tanstack query, https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/framework/react/reference/useMutation\n\n**File(s) affected:**`hooks/react-query/mutations/useProcessTransaction.ts`\n\n**Description:** In `useProcessTransaction.ts`, line 201-217 two asynchronous functions are invoked within a loop without any form of error handling, such as try/catch blocks or `.catch()` chains. If any of these functions fail — whether due to network errors, invalid responses, unhandled rejections, or internal logic bugs — the application has no mechanism to recover, degrade gracefully, or even report the failure.\n\nIn modern applications, especially those using JavaScript or TypeScript, unhandled promise rejections can cause:\n\n*   Application crashes.\n*   Broken user flows (in frontend apps).\n*   Silent failure of important operations.\n*   Security implications if failure paths are not accounted for.\n\nThis kind of failure is especially dangerous in production environments where async behavior is core to I/O operations, external API communication, database access, and background tasks.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\n*   Wrap all asynchronous calls in try/catch blocks when using async/await:\n\n```\ntry {\n  await doSomethingAsync();\n} catch (err) {\n  // Handle error: log, retry, alert user, etc.\n}\n```\n\n*   Attach `.catch()` handlers if using `.then()` chains:\n\n```\ndoSomethingAsync()\n  .then(result => { /* success logic */ })\n  .catch(error => { /* handle error */ });\n```\n\n*   Log all unexpected errors, ideally with enough context to diagnose them, but avoid exposing sensitive data.\n*   Optionally implement fallback mechanisms, retries with exponential backoff, or alerting depending on the importance of the operation.\n*   Robust error handling is critical in asynchronous code. Omitting it undermines the reliability and safety of the application and increases the likelihood of unpredictable behavior under real-world failure conditions.",
    "summary": "\nThe client has marked a bug as \"Fixed\" in a file called `useProcessTransaction.ts`. The bug was caused by two asynchronous functions being called in a loop without proper error handling, which could lead to application crashes, broken user flows, and security issues. The recommendation is to wrap all asynchronous calls in try/catch blocks or attach `.catch()` handlers, log errors, and potentially implement fallback mechanisms. Proper error handling is important for the reliability and safety of the application.",
