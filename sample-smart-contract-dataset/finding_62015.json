    "content": "**Update**\nThe client fixed the issue in commit `d9b8eebf84b2bca4b761a86080fe381ffff6a0ba` and provided the following explanation:\n\n> Already fixed in this commit\n\n**File(s) affected:**`contracts/Factory.vy`\n\n**Description:** In the function `fill_staker_vpool()`, a `staker` contract is deployed for the given `market` if the `staker_impl` contract address is set and if the `staker` contract was not already deployed from executing `add_market()`. However, the `staker_impl` contract address is not updatable in the `Factory` contract. Therefore, if the `staker_impl` is not set during deployment, the `staker` contract will not be deployed when `fill_staker_vpool()` is called as the following code block will never execute:\n\n```\nif market.staker == empty(address) and self.staker_impl != empty(address):\n    market.staker = create_from_blueprint(\n        self.staker_impl,\n        market.lt)\n```\n\n**Recommendation:** Create a setter function for the `staker_impl` address.",
