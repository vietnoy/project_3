    "title": "[MNBD1-12] Insufficient Check of Approval Delay in BondingCurvePool",
    "content": "**Severity:** Medium\n\n**Path:** contracts/BondingCurvePool.sol#L95-L100 \n\n**Description:** In the `BondingCurvePool.buyTokens()` function, lines 95–100 attempt to enforce a delay between a user’s approval and their first token purchase:\n```\nif (firstApprovalBlock[to] > 0 && lastBuyBlock[to] == 0) {\n  require(\n    block.number > firstApprovalBlock[to] + APPROVE_DELAY,\n    'Please wait ~2.5s after approving before buying'\n  );\n}\n```\nHowever, this check can be bypassed if the user never calls the `registerApproval()` function before purchasing. In that case, `firstApprovalBlock[to]` remains at its default value of zero, making the condition `block.number > firstApprovalBlock[to] + APPROVE_DELAY` trivially true.\n\nAs a result, users can skip the intended delay and buy tokens immediately, defeating the purpose of the `APPROVE_DELAY` restriction.\n\n**Remediation:**  Consider adding the following requirement:\n```\n++  require(firstApprovalBlock[to] != 0, 'User must be approved first'); \n\n    if (firstApprovalBlock[to] > 0 && lastBuyBlock[to] == 0) {\n      require(\n        block.number > firstApprovalBlock[to] + APPROVE_DELAY,\n        'Please wait ~2.5s after approving before buying'\n      );\n    }\n```\n\n\n**Status:**  Fixed\n\n- - -",
    "summary": "\nThis bug report discusses a medium severity issue in the `BondingCurvePool.sol` contract. In the `buyTokens()` function, there is a check to enforce a delay between a user's approval and their first token purchase. However, this check can be bypassed if the user does not call the `registerApproval()` function before purchasing, making the delay ineffective. The suggested solution is to add a requirement that the user must be approved before buying tokens. This issue has been fixed.",
