    "content": "**Update**\nMarked as \"Fixed\" by the client. Addressed in: `ffda07756c53963c20a254c11c97f6809d08cfaf`.\n\n**File(s) affected:**`SapienVault.sol`\n\n**Description:** The `stake()` and `increaseAmount()` functions allow users to add tokens to stakes without validation that the initial stake's lockup period has not ended. This can allow for some stakes where the new `weightedStartTime + effectiveLockUpPeriod < block.timestamp` meaning the stake is immediately unlocked. This allows users to benefit from an increased multiplier while being able to unlock their tokens at any time.\n\n**Recommendation:** Consider checking if a user's existing stake has expired before allowing them to add additional tokens via `stake()` or `increaseAmount()` functions. Alternatively, reset the weighted start time to the current timestamp when adding to expired stakes.",
    "summary": "\nThe client has marked a bug as \"Fixed\" in the `SapienVault.sol` file. The issue was that the `stake()` and `increaseAmount()` functions did not properly validate the lockup period for adding tokens to a stake. This could result in some stakes being immediately unlocked, allowing users to benefit from a higher multiplier while still being able to withdraw their tokens at any time. The recommendation is to check if a user's existing stake has expired before allowing them to add more tokens, or to reset the start time if the stake has expired.",
