    "content": "**Update**\nMarked as \"Acknowledged\" by the client. The client provided the following explanation:\n\n> Expect this to be fixed by the a CIP that reduces the create fee to zero.\n\n**File(s) affected:**`daml/splice-amulet/daml/Splice/AmuletRules.daml`\n\n**Description:** The`splitAndBurn`function is to burn fees via a self-transfer of an Amulet with the corresponding fee amount, thereby incurring a creation fee in addition the burned amount. The protocol handles this creation fee differently across various choices.\n\nIn`AmuletRules_BuyMemberTraffic`, the amount passed to`splitAndBurn`is calculated as`trafficCostAmulet - transferConfigAmulet.createFee.fee`. This ensures the user is charged exactly the`trafficCostAmulet`, with the`createFee`being effectively absorbed.\n\nFor choices involving`computeTransferPreapprovalFee`, the calculated`amuletPaid` is passed directly to`splitAndBurn` without deducting the creation fee. The client has noted this was an intentional decision for these preapproval-related functions, with the additional`createFee`serving as an economic disincentive against spamming these choices.\n\n**Recommendation:** The client is aware of this discrepancy and indicated that the`createFee` may be reduced to zero in the future, which would naturally resolve this inconsistency.\n\nIn the event that the`createFee`is not removed, consider aligning all calls to`splitAndBurn`to subtract the`createFee`from the primary calculated cost. If a base fee independent of the approval duration is desired, it should be explicitly defined in `computeTransferPreapprovalFee` rather than implicitly inherited from the `createFee`.",
