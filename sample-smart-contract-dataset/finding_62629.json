    "content": "\n_Resolved_\n\nIn the funnel vault contract `protocolFeeClaimer` is set only in the initialize to admin and has no setter function. If the admin address changes (e.g., role revoked/granted to a new address) or the claimer key is lost/compromised, protocol fees added via addToClaimer become unclaimable forever, as only the old claimer can call claimFees.\n\nAdmin can emergency withdraw, but that abandons accounting (known issue), risking over-claims or state corruption.\n\nThis leads to permanent lockup of protocol fees if claimer changes, affecting protocol sustainability. \n\nThis is how it can arise\n\n- Init sets claimer=admin.\n- Revoke DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE from initial admin, grant to new.\n- Accrue protocol fees -> added to old claimer. New admin can't claim, fees locked.\n\nRecommendation is to add `setProtocolFeeClaimer(address newClaimer)` restricted to `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, with `newClaimer != address(0)` check.\n\n\n\n",
