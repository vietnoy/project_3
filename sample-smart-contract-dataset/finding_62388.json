    "content": "**Severity:** Informational\n\n**Description:** There are some conditionals that could be optimised by changing the order of elements by frequency/gas cost to allow for early exits and save gas on each function call.\n\nWe have identified the following locations:\n\n1. `CErc721.sol:repayBorrowFresh` on line 381, there is a storage read in the first element and a \n\n2. `CEther.sol:repayBorrowFresh` on line 172;\n\n3. `CToken.sol:repayBorrowFresh` on line 700.\n\nIn each of the above mentioned locations, there is a storage read in the first element and a local stack variable in the second element. Since this conditional won’t always be triggered, switching the elements would allow for an early exit without a storage read, saving gas on each partial repay.\n```\nif (accountTokens[borrower] == 0 && accountBorrowsNew == 0) {\n    comptroller.autoExitMarkets(borrower); // silent failure allowed\n}\n```\n\n**Remediation:**  Change the mentioned code locations to:\n```\nif (accountBorrowsNew == 0 && accountTokens[borrower] == 0) {\n```\n\n**Status:** Fixed\n\n- - -",
