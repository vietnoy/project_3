    "content": "**Severity:** Critical\n\n**Path:** Crate.sol\n\n**Description:** The functions `safeWithdraw`, and `safeRedeem` have inconsistent debt calculation logic.\n\nA bad actor can call `safeWithdraw/safeRedeem` function with such parameters that revert `swapVirtualToAsset` function call (for example, with a past deadline). That function is executed in try/catch block, but before the `try/catch` the `_withdraw()` function decreases `liquidityPool.debt`. Even if `swapToVirtualAsset()` reverts the `liquidityPool.debt` will already be decreased.\n\nAs a result, `_withdraw()` function decreases `crate.totalAssets()` twice. It affects all calculations, f.e `increaseLiquidity`, `decreaseLiquidity`, `rebalanceLiquidity`, `shareToAsset`, `assetToShare`, etc.\n```    function _withdraw(\n        uint256 _amount,\n        uint256 _shares,\n        uint256 _minAmountOut,\n        uint256 _deadline,\n        address _receiver,\n        address _owner\n    ) internal nonReentrant returns (uint256 recovered) {\n        if (_amount == 0 || _shares == 0) revert AmountZero();\n\n        // We spend the allowance if the msg.sender isn't the receiver\n        if (msg.sender != _owner) {\n            _spendAllowance(_owner, msg.sender, _shares);\n        }\n\n        // Check for rounding error since we round down in previewRedeem.\n        if (convertToAssets(_shares) == 0)\n            revert IncorrectAssetAmount(convertToAssets(_shares));\n\n        // We burn the tokens\n        _burn(_owner, _shares);\n\n        // Allows to take a withdraw fee\n        _amount = (_amount * (MAX_BPS - withdrawFee)) / MAX_BPS;\n\n        if (liquidityPoolEnabled) {\n            // We don't take into account the eventual slippage, since it will\n            // be paid to the depositoors\n            liquidityPool.debt -= Math.min(_amount, liquidityPool.debt);\n            try\n                liquidityPool.swap.swapVirtualToAsset(\n                    _amount,\n                    _minAmountOut,\n                    _deadline,\n                    _receiver\n                )\n            returns (uint256 dy) {\n                recovered = dy;\n            } catch {\n                // if the swap fails, we send the funds available\n                asset.safeTransfer(_receiver, _amount);\n                recovered = _amount;\n            }\n        } else {\n            // If the liquidity pool is not enabled, we send the funds available\n            // This allows for the bootstrapping of the pool at start\n            asset.safeTransfer(_receiver, _amount);\n            recovered = _amount;\n        }\n\n        if (_minAmountOut > 0 && recovered < _minAmountOut)\n            revert IncorrectAssetAmount(recovered);\n\n        emit Withdraw(msg.sender, _receiver, _owner, _amount, _shares);\n        return (recovered);\n    }\n```\n\n**Remediation:**  We would recommend to move decreasing liquididyPool.dept decreasing in `try` block. \n\n**Status:**  Fixed\n\n\n- - -",
    "summary": "\nSeverity: Critical\nPath: Crate.sol\nDescription: The functions safeWithdraw and safeRedeem have inconsistent debt calculation logic, allowing a bad actor to manipulate the system and potentially steal funds. This is due to the fact that the _withdraw() function decreases the liquidityPool.debt before executing the try/catch block, which can result in incorrect calculations and affect other functions such as increaseLiquidity, decreaseLiquidity, and assetToShare.\nRemediation: The recommended solution is to move the decrease of liquidityPool.debt inside the try block to ensure accurate calculations and prevent potential attacks.\nStatus: This issue has been fixed.",
