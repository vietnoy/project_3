    "title": "Arithmetic Overflow in `getPrice` When Feeds Return Large Values",
    "content": "##### Description\nThis issue has been identified within the `getPrice` function of the `ChainlinkOracleComposite` contract. \n\n`getPrice` normalises each feed answer and then multiplies the current composite price by that rate:\n\n```solidity\nrate = uint256(price) \n     * 10**(SCALING_DECIMALS - feed.decimals());\ncompositePrice = (compositePrice * rate) \n               / SCALING_FACTOR; // 36-dec fixed-point\n```\n\nIf a feed reports `price > 1.16 * 10^(5 + feed.decimals)` (≈ $100 000 when denominated in wei), the term  \n\n```\ncompositePrice * rate * 10^36\n```\n\nexceeds the 256‑bit limit. The call reverts with arithmetic overflow, freezing every contract that depends on this oracle for lending, liquidation, or pricing logic.\n\nThe issue is classified as **high** severity because a single inflated data point bricks the entire oracle and all protocols integrated with it. \n\n##### Recommendation\nWe recommend either replacing the simple `* /` pair with a 512‑bit safe‑math library such as OpenZeppelin’s `mulDiv` or reducing `SCALING_DECIMALS`.\n",
    "summary": "\nThe `ChainlinkOracleComposite` contract has a bug in its `getPrice` function. This causes the contract to freeze if a feed reports a price higher than $100,000, resulting in all contracts that depend on this oracle to also freeze. To fix this, it is recommended to either use a 512-bit safe-math library or reduce the `SCALING_DECIMALS` value. This issue is classified as high severity as it can affect multiple protocols that use this oracle.",
