    "content": "\n_Resolved_\n\nThe `tradeFee` variable is documented in `MarketplaceStorage.sol` as a \"percentage in BIPS (1% = 100)\" but is implemented in `executeTrade()` as a fixed amount in token units. The contract initializes `tradeFee` to `10e6` with a comment \"1 USDC,\" confirming it's intended as an absolute amount. This inconsistency creates confusion about how fees are calculated and could lead to admin errors when setting fee values.\n\nRecommendation:\nUpdate the natspac in `MarketplaceStorage.sol` to accurately reflect that `tradeFee` is a fixed token amount rather than a percentage. Change the comment to:\n```solidity\n/// @notice Fixed trade fee amount in token units (e.g., 10e6 = 1 USDC)\nuint256 public tradeFee;\n```\nAlternatively, if percentage-based fees are desired, modify the `executeTrade()` implementation to calculate fees as a percentage of trade value.\n\n\n",
