    "title": "[H-06] Incorrect `pendingCounts` calculation",
    "content": "\n_Resolved_\n\n## Severity\n\n**Impact:** High\n\n**Likelihood:** Medium\n\n## Description\n\nIn SpinLottery contract, users can spin to win one prize NFT. The spin result is based on the randomness from Chainlink VRF. The spin result is asynchronous. When users trigger `spin` function, we will calculate the `pendingCounts`. Because there are some previous `spin` transactions, these transactions' results are unknown, and these `spin` transactions may win and claim some prize NFTs from the contract. So when we trigger `spin`, we need to check current prize in the pool and also the potential claimed prize. \n\nThe `pendingCounts` is used to record the potential claimed prize NFT before this `spin`. \n\nAccording to current implementation, if the user wins in one spin, the user will gain one prize NFT. The problem here is that in function `calculatePendingPrizesForRarity`, when we calculate the `pendingCount`, the `pendingCount` is related to `_prizeCount`, `weight`, `totalRarityWeight`. The `_prizeCount` can be controlled by users. When users trigger `spin` with one large `_prizeCount`, we will get one large `pendingCount`. The `pendingCount` will be updated into `prizePools[i].pendingCount`.\n\nThis will cause the later `spin` may be blocked.\n\nIn function `calculatePendingPrizesForRarity`, the parameter `_prizeCount` is expected to be the prize count that we will distribute according to the commnet. However, this is incorrect. The `_prizeCount` can be controlled by the user, and no matter which value `_prizeCount` is, the distribute prize count for one spin will always be `1`. This will cause some logic related to `_prizeCount` in `spin` are incorrect.\n\n```solidity\n    function spin(uint256 _totalSlots, uint256 _prizeCount) external whenNotPaused returns (uint256) {\n        for (uint8 i = 1; i <= maxRarityId; i++) {\n            if (rarityConfigs[i].active) {\n                pendingCounts[i] = calculatePendingPrizesForRarity(_prizeCount, i);\n                totalPending += pendingCounts[i];\n            }\n        }\n        if (totalPending == 0) {\n            for (uint8 i = 1; i <= maxRarityId; i++) {\n                if (rarityConfigs[i].active) {\n                    pendingCounts[i] = 1;\n                    totalPending = 1;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        for (uint8 i = 1; i <= maxRarityId; i++) {\n            if (pendingCounts[i] > 0) {\n                uint256 available = getAvailablePrizes(i);\n                uint256 pending = prizePools[i].pendingCount;\n                if (available - pending < pendingCounts[i]) {\n                    revert InsufficientPrizes();\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        for (uint8 i = 1; i <= maxRarityId; i++) {\n            if (pendingCounts[i] > 0) {\n                prizePools[i].pendingCount += uint96(pendingCounts[i]);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    function calculatePendingPrizesForRarity(uint256 _prizeCount, uint8 rarity) internal view returns (uint256) {\n        if (_prizeCount == 1) {\n            // For single prizes, prioritize first active rarity\n            return rarity == 1 && rarityConfigs[1].active ? 1 : 0;\n        }\n        \n        if (!rarityConfigs[rarity].active) return 0;\n        \n        uint256 weight = rarityConfigs[rarity].weight;\n@>        uint256 pendingCount = (_prizeCount * weight) / totalRarityWeight;\n        \n        if (_prizeCount > 1 && pendingCount == 0 && weight > 0) {\n            pendingCount = 1;\n        }\n        \n        return pendingCount;\n    }\n```\n## Recommendations\n\nRevisit the `pendingCount`'s calculation.\n\n\n\n",

However, this `_prizeCount` can be controlled by users and does not accurately reflect the number of prizes that will be distributed in one spin. This can cause problems with the logic in the `spin` function and may block future spins.\n\nThe recommendation is to revisit the calculation of `pendingCount` to ensure it accurately reflects the number of prizes to be distributed.",
