    "content": "\n_Resolved_\n\nWhen a vault is created via the `createVault` function, the factory verifies that the adapter address provided by the user corresponds to a registered adapter. However, it does **not verify** whether the adapter's associated bytecode (template) is still valid and present in the factory’s `adapterTypeByteCode` mapping.\n\nThe system allows the contract owner to \"delete\" (deactivate) adapter templates by clearing their bytecode from `adapterTypeByteCode`. Nevertheless, a malicious user can pre-deploy multiple adapter instances (using a soon-to-be-deprecated adapter type), and after the bytecode has been deleted by the owner, these instances can still be used for vault creation. This allows the bypassing of owner-intended deactivation of adapter types, leading to the unintended creation of vaults with deprecated adapter logic.\n\nThe issue arises from missing logic that should enforce that **only adapter instances with an active (undeleted) adapter type bytecode can be used**.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nAdd a check in the `createVault` function to ensure that the adapter's associated type ID still has valid bytecode in the factory's storage. Specifically:\n\n```solidity\nbytes memory adapterBytecode = adapterTypeByteCode[_adapterInfo.adapterTypeId];\nrequire(adapterBytecode.length != 0, \"BDE\"); // Bytecode Deleted\n```\n\nThis ensures that even if an adapter instance was deployed prior to bytecode deletion, it cannot be used to create new vaults after its template has been deactivated.\n\n\n\n",
