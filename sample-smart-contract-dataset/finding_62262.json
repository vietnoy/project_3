It can be bundled atomically in a single block via PBS (like flashbots) on Ethereum. The impact is much higher, especially when skewed during the last block of the given deadline of the proposal.\n\n## Recommendation\n- Avoid using `currentTotalSupply` where it can be skewed.\n- If token supply has increased or decreased by x% compared to the last recorded supply, compute using both min and max token supply and take the conservative figures.\n- Consider making such cases explicit in the documentation if risk is acceptable.\n\n## Status\n- Aragon: Fixed in PR 47\n- Spearbit: Fix verified",
    "summary": "\nThe bug report discusses a potential issue in a piece of code that is used to check if certain thresholds have been reached in a voting system. The code uses a variable called `currentTotalSupply` to make these calculations. However, the report raises concerns about how this variable can be manipulated by malicious actors in certain scenarios, leading to inaccurate results. The report recommends avoiding the use of this variable and suggests alternative approaches to ensure accurate calculations. The issue has been fixed in a recent update.",
