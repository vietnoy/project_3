    "content": "\n_Resolved_\n\nThe `RoleBasedAccessControl` contract, which inherits from `Initializable`, `ERC1155Upgradeable`, and `UUPSUpgradeable`, defines state variables such as `pendingSuperAdmin` and `roleTransferExpiry`.\n\n```solidity\ncontract RoleBasedAccessControl is Initializable, ERC1155Upgradeable, UUPSUpgradeable {\n    /// @dev ID for the super admin role that has full system access\n    uint256 public constant SUPER_ADMIN_ROLE = 1;\n    /// @dev ID for the role manager role that can assign/revoke other roles\n    uint256 public constant ROLE_MANAGER_ROLE = 2;\n    /// @dev Time window during which a super admin role transfer must be accepted\n    uint256 public constant ROLE_TRANSFER_EXPIRY_DEADLINE = 2 days;\n\n    /// @dev Address that is proposed to become the new super admin\n    address public pendingSuperAdmin;\n    /// @dev Timestamp when the current super admin role transfer expires\n    uint256 public roleTransferExpiry;\n```\n\n**However, it does not implement a storage gap or namespace layout as recommended by best practices for upgradeable contracts.** \n\nWhile this omission does not cause immediate issues, since no contracts currently inherit from `RoleBasedAccessControl`, it is still strongly recommended to include a storage gap. Adding a storage gap proactively helps prevent potential storage collisions in future development, especially if the contract is later inherited.\n\n\n\n",
