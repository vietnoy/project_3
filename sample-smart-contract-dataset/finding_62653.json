    "title": "Incorrect approval in SVFHook contract",
    "content": "## Severity: Low Risk\n\n**Context:** SVFHook.sol#L279, SVFHook.sol#L280\n\n**Description:**  \nThe `beforeInitialize` function of the `SVFHook` contract intends to approve the `token0` and `token1` assets to the `poolManager` contract. However, it fails to do so because the second approval is instead done to the `PERMIT2` address. It's also worth noting that these approvals to the `poolManager` appear to be unnecessary, as the contract is approving the `positionManager` contract to handle tokens. This might be the reason why the incorrect approval described was left unnoticed.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nReview the approvals in the `beforeInitialize` function, leaving only those strictly necessary for the system to work as intended. Do note that there's a finding titled \"Use of infinite approvals in the SVFHook contract\" related to the infinite approvals used in the `beforeInitialize` function, which should also be considered when tackling this issue.\n\n**Semantic Layer:** Fixed in PR 2.\n\n**Spearbit:** Fix verified.",
