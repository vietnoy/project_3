The caller is a trusted account, however, order does matter in case of a tie for high scores and team leader.\n\n## Recommendation  \nEnforce task fulfilment order for fairness in tied scores. In lieu of enforcing on chain, consider handling and enforcement on the backend.\n\n## Semantic Layer  \nIn the backend, we have relevant measures to deal with all missed tasks (pending tasks); tasks can be completed out of order.\n\n## Semantic Layer  \nAcknowledged. We previously recommended handling all tasks in order, but later we changed to the current mode that allows unordered processing.\n\n## Spearbit  \nAcknowledged.",
