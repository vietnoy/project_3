    "content": "**Description:** The intention of the protocol as specified in the kick-off call and in discussion with the client is that users should be able to permissionlessly:\n* buy hBTC from a decentralized exchange\n* stake/unstake hBTC in a permissionless manner via `StakingVault`\n\n**Impact:** In the current implementation `StakingVault` uses `onlyWhitelisted` modifiers on many core functions which prohibits users who permissionlessly bought hBTC using a decentralized exchange from subsequently staking their hBTC and earning yield.\n\nTo enable this the admin would need to call `setGlobalWhitelist` which would effectively disable the whitelist and compliance checks anyway.\n\n**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider using only the \"blacklist\" functionality in `StakingVault` but removing the \"whitelist\" functionality to allow users to permissionlessly participate in staking and earning yield.\n\n**Syntetika:**\nFixed in commit [86384fe](https://github.com/SyntetikaLabs/monorepo/commit/86384fe1504780338649d25f720fb78b25132875).\n\n**Cyfrin:** Verified.",
