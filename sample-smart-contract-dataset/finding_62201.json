    "content": "**Description:** `StakingVault::redeem, withdraw` use the `onlyWhitelisted` modifier to verify that `msg.sender` is whitelisted or is compliant, as this modifier ends up calling `Whitelist::isAddressWhitelisted`:\n```solidity\nfunction isAddressWhitelisted(address user) public view returns (bool) {\n    if (manualWhitelist[user] || globalWhitelist) {\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    return complianceChecker.isCompliant(user);\n}\n```\n\nIf a user was whitelisted or was compliant when they created the withdrawal/redemption, but was then removed from the whitelist or became non-compliant, they will still be able to call `StakingVault::claimWithdraw` to withdraw their assets after the cooldown period.\n\n**Recommended Mitigation:** `StakingVault::claimWithdraw` should use modifier `onlyWhitelisted(msg.sender)` to ensure that the caller is still whitelisted or compliant; `onlyWhitelisted(receiver)` could also be used to enforce that the destination address is also whitelisted.\n\n**Syntetika:**\nFixed in commit [86384fe](https://github.com/SyntetikaLabs/monorepo/commit/86384fe1504780338649d25f720fb78b25132875) by removing the whitelist functionality entirely from `StakingVault` to resolve finding L-4.\n\n**Cyfrin:** Verified.",
