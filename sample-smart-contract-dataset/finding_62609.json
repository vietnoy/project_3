    "title": "[L-12] Risk of packet loss in `authorizedOpenPacket()` with empty cards",
    "content": "\n_Resolved_\n\nThere is a critical vulnerability in the interaction between `CardAllocationPool.sol` and `Packet.sol` when handling **OPEN_PACKET** burn type. When a user initiates a burn with **OPEN_PACKET** type, a manager can call `authorizedOpenPacket()` in `CardAllocationPool.sol` to open packets with specific cards.\nThe issue is that the `uthorizedOpenPacket()` function does not verify that the cards array contains at least one card. \nIf a manager calls this function with an empty cards array, either maliciously or by mistake, it will still proceed to call `finalizeOpen()` in `Packet.sol`:\n```solidity\nif (burnType == BurnType.INSTANT_OPEN_PACKET) {\n    // ... INSTANT_OPEN_PACKET handling ...\n} else {\n    _burn(packetId);\n}\n```\nThis results in the packet being permanently burned without the user receiving any card in return, as the cards array was empty. This is a significant loss for the user who initiated the burn process.\n\nTo resolve this, modify the `authorizedOpenPacket()` function in `CardAllocationPool.sol` to require a non-empty cards array.\n\n\n\n",
