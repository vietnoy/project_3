    "title": "`unstakeDelay` Can Be Exploited to DoS Withdraws",
    "content": "**Update**\nMarked as \"Fixed\" by the client. Addressed in: `6fe0bf5d4c771a7c32d1c50721773354ea23dfdf`.\n\n**File(s) affected:**`CampStakingVault.sol`\n\n**Description:** This fork of the Synthetix `StakingRewards` contract introduces a `unstakeDelay` variable that is intended to enforce a minimum duration between `stake` and `withdraw` operations. For this purpose the contract records the last deposit timestamp for each user. However, the `stake()` function can be executed by a delegator, and does not require a minimum deposit. This way a user can stake a small amount on behalf of another user before their `unstakeDelay` passes, extending the lock and thus blocking them from withdrawing their tokens.\n\n**Exploit Scenario:**\n\n1.   Alice stakes 10 CAMP tokens. \n2.   Shortly before Alice `unstakeDelay` is exceeded, Mallory deposits 1 wei of CAMP for Alice, thus restarting the `unstakeDelay` for Alice.\n3.   Mallory repeats this, blocking Alice from withdrawing.\n\n**Recommendation:** Usually unstake delays are best implemented with accounting mechanisms that consider individual deposits instead of the user balance in its entirety. However, this would require a significant redesign of the reward calculation system. Instead, consider removing the `unstakeDelay` entirely if possible, or the option to `stake` as delegate for another user. A minimum stake amount would increase the cost of the attack significantly, but may not protect very large stakers.",
    "summary": "\nThe client has marked a bug as \"Fixed\" in the `CampStakingVault.sol` file. The bug allowed users to exploit the `unstakeDelay` feature, which was meant to enforce a minimum duration between staking and withdrawing tokens. This was possible because the `stake()` function could be executed by someone else on behalf of a user, without requiring a minimum deposit. This allowed malicious users to block others from withdrawing their tokens by repeatedly making small deposits on their behalf. The recommendation is to either remove the `unstakeDelay` feature or add a minimum stake amount to prevent such attacks.",
