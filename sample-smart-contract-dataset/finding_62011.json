Optionally, allow the admin role to change its value. Further, test this for correctness.",
    "summary": "\nThe bug report is about a problem that was found in a client's code. The issue was fixed by the client, and the explanation for the fix was provided. The affected file is `LT.vy` and the problem was that the `min_admin_fee` was not assigned, which meant that no admin fees could be charged from the LT contract. The recommendation is to assign `min_admin_fee` during the deployment of the LT contract and to allow the admin role to change its value. It is also suggested to test this to make sure it is working correctly.",
