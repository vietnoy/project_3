    "content": "\n_Resolved_\n\n## Severity\n\n**Impact:** Medium\n\n**Likelihood:** Medium\n\n## Description\n\nThe `generateListingSignatureHash` function in the Marketplace contract creates a hash for a listing request that does not include a nonce mechanism.\n\n```solidity\n    function generateListingSignatureHash(ListingRequest calldata listing) public view returns (bytes32) {\n        return _hashTypedDataV4(\n            keccak256(\n                abi.encode(\n                    LISTING_TYPEHASH,\n                    listing.tokenContractAddress,\n                    listing.tokenId,\n                    listing.price,\n                    listing.acceptedCurrency,\n                    listing.deadline,\n                    listing.owner,\n                    listing.chainId\n                )\n            )\n        );\n    }\n```\n\nThis omission means that once the owner signs the listing, the signature remains valid (until `deadline`) even if the owner subsequently modifies the price. **And once a signature is signed, there is no way to revoke it.**\n\nThis creates a vulnerability where a malicious attacker could withhold the owner's signature until the `deadline`. If the price of the asset increases (a common occurrence with volatile assets), the attacker could use the original signed price to execute a purchase, undermining the integrity of the listing process and potentially leading to financial losses for the seller.\n\n```solidity\n        bytes32 listingHash = generateListingSignatureHash(listing.request);\n        if (usedListings[listingHash]) revert ListingAlreadyUsed();\n        if (!IWhitelistRegistry(whitelistRegistry).isWhitelisted(listing.request.tokenContractAddress)) {\n            revert NFTNotWhitelisted();\n        }\n        if (IERC721(listing.request.tokenContractAddress).ownerOf(listing.request.tokenId) != listing.request.owner) {\n            revert NotOwner();\n        }\n\n        if (!SignatureChecker.isValidSignatureNow(listing.request.owner, listingHash, listing.sig)) {\n            revert InvalidSignature();\n        }\n```\n\nThis is the same for other signature generation in `isValidTrade` and `isValidBid`.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nTo enhance the security of the listing process, implement a nonce mechanism that is included in the signature hash generation. This nonce should be unique for each listing and should be incremented with each new listing request from the owner.  **More specifically, the owner should be able to disable a signature once it becomes invalid.**\n\n\n\n",
    "summary": "\nThe bug report is about a function called `generateListingSignatureHash` in the Marketplace contract. This function creates a hash for a listing request, but it does not include a nonce mechanism. This means that once the owner signs the listing, the signature remains valid even if the owner changes the price. This creates a vulnerability where a malicious attacker could use the original signed price to execute a purchase, potentially causing financial losses for the seller. To fix this issue, it is recommended to implement a nonce mechanism that is unique for each listing and can be disabled by the owner if needed.",
