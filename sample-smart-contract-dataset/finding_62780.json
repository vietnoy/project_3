    "content": "**Update**\nMarked as \"Acknowledged\" by the client.\n\nRefunded fees will remain in the contract and subsidise future fees.\n\n**File(s) affected:**`CampTimelockEscrowNativeOFT.sol`\n\n**Description:** This contract exposes an empty `receive()` function. This is necessary to allow for refunds from the LayerZero system. The refund address is set for each `send()` operation, but is currently always set to this contract. However, the contract does not offer any option to rescue these unaccounted tokens, causing them to be trapped in the contract.\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement logic that handles refunds in some desired way, for example by adding a mechanism that allows the owner to withdraw funds received by this function. Further consider to request a refund address for deposits to correctly repay users in case of failure.",
