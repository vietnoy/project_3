Currently rounded down,\n    } else {\n        pmTotalLong = pmLong > pmAlone ? pmLong - pmAlone : 0; // `pmAlone` needs to be rounded down. Currently rounded down,\n    }\n}\n\n(uint256 B_Short, uint256 pmShort) = (user.pmData.sumShortSize, user.pmData.sumShortPM);\nuint256 pmTotalShort;\n\nif (S > 0 && B_Short <= S.abs()) {\n    pmTotalShort = 0;\n} else {\n    if (S < 0) {\n        pmTotalShort = pmShort + pmAlone; // `pmAlone` needs to be rounded up. Currently rounded down,\n    } else {\n        pmTotalShort = pmShort > pmAlone ? pmShort - pmAlone : 0; // `pmAlone` needs to be rounded down. Currently rounded down,\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Recommendations\n1. In general, one needs to make sure the value returned by `_calcPM(...)` is overestimated.\n2. The accumulated values of `user.pmData.sumLongPM`, `user.pmData.sumShortPM` in memory or storage would always need to round up.\n3. Two variants of `__calcPMFromRate` need to be defined, and depending on the call site, the variant with the correct rounding direction needs to be used.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n- **Pendle Finance**: Acknowledged. Won't fix as we will scale all to `1e18` to avoid having to be too strict with rounding.\n- **Spearbit**: Acknowledged.",
