    "title": "RampA Logic Not Handling Very Low `initialA`",
    "content": "##### Description\nThis issue has been identified within the `rampA` function of the `RampAController` contract. \n\nIf `initialA` is extremely low (e.g., set to `1`), the code’s checks may cause the function to revert due to the ratio constraints. This leads to an inability to initiate ramping from a very small `initialA`. \n\nThe issue is classified as **low** severity because it restricts certain use cases rather than posing an immediate security risk.\n##### Recommendation\nWe recommend either restricting the `initialA` to equal to 1 or adjusting the logic to handle very small `initialA` values gracefully, for example by allowing a special case or appropriately relaxing the ratio constraints when `initialA` is set to 1.",
