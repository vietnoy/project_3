    "title": "Misleading or Incorrect Comments",
    "content": "##### Description\nThis issue has been identified in both `PTokenModule` and `RiskEngineModule` due to comments that do not accurately reflect the underlying code logic:\n\n- **`PTokenModule`** \n  - `_getReserveShares(...)` is described as retrieving a “block number” but actually handles the distribution of reserves.\n  - `_getBlockTimestamp()` also claims to retrieve the “block number” but returns `block.timestamp`.\n\n- **`RiskEngineModule`** \n  - `exitMarket(...)` has a line comment that says:\n    ```solidity!\n    /* Return true if the sender is not already ‘in’ the market as collateral */\n    ```\n    However, the function does not return a boolean—it checks membership and exits early if the user is not already in the market.\n\nSuch inconsistencies can mislead developers or auditors who rely on comments to understand the code.\n\n##### Recommendation\nWe recommend updating or removing incorrect comments to ensure that they accurately describe the functions’ purposes.\n",
