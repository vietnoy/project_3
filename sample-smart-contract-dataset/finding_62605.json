    "content": "\n_Resolved_\n\nThe `Marketplace.sol` lacks a mechanism for offer makers to revoke their offers before the deadline expires. While the contract implements `revokedListings` for seller listings through the `revokeListing()` function, there is no equivalent functionality for offers. This creates a security concern as requesters cannot cancel their offers if market conditions change rapidly or if they made a mistake, forcing them to rely solely on short deadlines, which is insufficient in fast-moving crypto markets.\n\n\n\n",
