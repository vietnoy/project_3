    "content": "## Security Report\n\n## Severity: Low Risk\n\n### Context\n(No context files were provided by the reviewer)\n\n### Summary\nThe `LockManagerBase` contract has a public `setPluginAddress()` function through which the plugin address is set once during its initialization. This function has no authentication and is at danger of being frontrun by a malicious actor when it is not called within the same transaction that also deployed the contract implementing `LockManagerBase`.\n\n### Finding Description\nThere is a 1-to-1 relationship between the Lock Manager contract and the Plugin contract, both need the address of each other in order to interact with one another. Due to this deployment inter-dependency, the `setPluginAddress()` allows first deploying the Lock Manager contract, then the Plugin contract, and finally set the Plugin contract's address within the Lock Manager.\n\nIn the normal case, this shouldn't be a problem: Once `LockToVotePluginSetup` has deployed the implementation of `LockToVotePlugin`, the `LockToVotePluginSetup.prepareInstallation()` function makes sure that both `setPluginAddress()` and `initialize()` are called on both of the contracts. But this relies on the assumption that `LockToVotePluginSetup` will be used in all cases.\n\n### Recommendation\nIf this function is to be kept, consider adding a warning to it, such as \"Must be called within the same transaction as contract creation\" to prevent mistakes that invite malicious actors. Preferably, avoid having a public setter function in the first place by using (as provided by `utils/proxy.sol`) `predictProxyAddress()` to predict the plugin address. `LockManagerERC20` can then be deployed while passing the predicted plugin address into its constructor instead of needing the public setter function. Finally, the `LockToVotePlugin` can be deployed at the predicted address with `createSaltedProxyAndCall()` instead of `createProxyAndCall()` within `LockToVotePluginSetup.prepareInstallation()`.\n\n### Aragon\nFixed in PR 36.\n\n### Spearbit\nFix verified. Solves the issue by adding authentication to the public setter function, instead of using `CREATE2`.",
