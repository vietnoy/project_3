While this code itself was not in scope for this audit, we had to check some of it for compatibility with `MUSD` and were asked to consider revision [`011f84f0f6a701a9796fcac1ad29896c60b65344`](https://github.com/m0-foundation/evm-m-extensions/tree/011f84f0f6a701a9796fcac1ad29896c60b65344) for this.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that the submodule that is actually used in the [`mUSD`](https://github.com/m0-foundation/mUSD/) repository is at revision [`90f144deee35071e02b1ff0b62004b8d2435ddfe`](https://github.com/m0-foundation/evm-m-extensions/tree/90f144deee35071e02b1ff0b62004b8d2435ddfe) and therefore behind the commit hash we were given.\n\n#### Recommendation\n\nSince the `evm-m-extensions` are not in scope for this audit, we cannot give a recommendation as to which version to use. From the limited perspective of this review, the revision that is currently utilized in `mUSD` at the relevant commit hash is behind the one we were told was going to be used for `mUSD`.",
