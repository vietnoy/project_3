    "content": "**Update**\nMarked as \"Acknowledged\" by the client. The client provided the following explanation:\n\n> I disagree with this assessment. The multiplier will gradually increase up to the BASE_STAKE, and there are no dead zones. On mainnet, the requirement for a minimum BASE_STAKE will be removed, and the multiplier will be adjusted accordingly to prevent gaming the system by staking very little over a long period to achieve the maximum multiplier.\n\n![Image 78: Alert icon](https://certificate.quantstamp.com/full/sapien/ffb7e698-6178-46f0-8df8-52e537af70c0/static/media/success-icon-alert.4e26c8d3b65fdf9f4f0789a4086052ba.svg)\n\n**Update**\nMarked as \"Fixed\" by the client.

Addressed in: `b4eba62e3ccd45e83dc125a50c9f0bab44b2b446`. The client provided the following explanation:\n\n> The multiplier distribution has been amended to have more tiers and more equitably reward users for staking different amounts.\n\n**File(s) affected:**`SapienStaking.sol`\n\n**Description:** The function `SapienStaking.calculateMultiplier()` awards the same multiplier for a very wide range of stake amounts. One such example of this is that any `amount` from 980 tokens up to 999.999999999999999999 tokens will receive a multiplier of 149. This creates a large \"dead zone\" where users get no benefit from staking additional tokens, followed by a sharp cliff where 1 wei more suddenly increases the multiplier.\n\n**Recommendation:** Consider implementing a more granular calculation system by scaling the amounts before performing calculations.",
