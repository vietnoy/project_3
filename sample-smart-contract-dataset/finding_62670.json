    "content": "##### Description\nThis issue has been identified within the `zapOut` function of the `Zap` contract. \n\n```solidity\nuint256 lpTokenShares = ILPToken(lpToken).getSharesByPeggedToken(lpAmount);\nIERC20(lpToken).forceApprove(spa, lpTokenShares);\n```\n\nThe receiving `SelfPeggingAsset` contract expects `lpAmount` in token units, not in share units. When the share‑to‑token ratio drifts from 1 : 1, the SPA either reverts (too few tokens approved) or over‑burns the user’s balance. This blocks withdrawals and breaks Zap’s single‑transaction UX.\n\nThe issue is classified as *medium* severity because it disrupts normal withdrawals once the ratio changes, but does not break pool solvency. \n##### Recommendation\nWe recommend approving and passing the raw `lpAmount` (token units) to the `SelfPegingAsset` contract.",
    "summary": "\nThe `zapOut` function in the `Zap` contract has a bug that affects the `SelfPeggingAsset` contract. When the share-to-token ratio is not 1:1, the function either reverts or over-burns the user's balance, causing issues with withdrawals. To fix this, the raw `lpAmount` (token units) should be approved and passed to the `SelfPegingAsset` contract. This bug is classified as medium severity as it disrupts withdrawals but does not affect pool solvency.",
