    "content": "\n_Resolved_\n\nThe `MarketplaceAdmin` contract manages the `marketplaceAddress` and maintains a separate set of parameters, including variables like `acceptedCurrency`, etc. \n\n```solidity\ncontract MarketplaceAdmin is UUPSUpgradeable, RoleBasedAccessControlConsumer, MarketplaceStorage { // <= MarketplaceStorage here\n    /// @notice The address of the Marketplace contract \n    address public marketplaceAddress;\n    ...\n}\n```\nThis duplication of state management is not a best practice, as it increases complexity and the potential for inconsistencies between the two contracts.\n\nAdditionally, during the setter functions like `updateAcceptedCurrency` function, the local state is modified before attempting to update the corresponding parameter in the `Marketplace` contract. \n\n\n```solidity\n        address oldCurrency = acceptedCurrency;\n        acceptedCurrency = newERC20TokenAddress;\n        emit AcceptedCurrencyUpdated(oldCurrency, newERC20TokenAddress);\n\n        // Also update the currency in the Marketplace contract if it exists\n        if (marketplaceAddress != address(0)) {\n            // This will revert if the Marketplace contract doesn't exist or doesn't have this function\n            try Marketplace(marketplaceAddress).setAcceptedCurrency(newERC20TokenAddress) {\n                // Successfully called the function\n            } catch {\n                // Silently ignore errors\n            }\n        }\n```\n\nThe use of a `try-catch` block to handle this update means that **if the call fails silently, the local state and the state in the `Marketplace` contract could become inconsistent**, leading to confusion and potential errors in future transactions.\n\n\nRecommendations:\n\nUse a Single Source of Truth to eliminate the redundancy.\n\n\n\n",
