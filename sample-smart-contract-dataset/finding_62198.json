    "title": "`Minter` doesn't account for depegs, exchange rates and decimal precision mismatch between `baseAsset` and `hilBTCToken`, which can result in total loss scenarios for both users and protocol",
    "content": "**Description:** `Minter` supports conversion between two key assets, `baseAsset` and `hilBTCToken`:\n```solidity\n    /// @notice The token address of the base asset accepted for deposit (e.g., WBTC or a stablecoin)\n    IERC20 public immutable baseAsset;\n\n    /// @notice The token address of the HilBTC ERC-20 contract (which the Minter will mint/burn)\n    IMintableERC20 public immutable hilBTCToken;\n```\n\n* `baseAsset` explicitly can be `wBTC`, `USDC` or `USDT`; these can have various precision such as 8, 6 or 18 depending on the chain\n* `hilBTCToken` is explicitly always the protocol's synthetic bitcoin token `hBTC` having 8 decimal precision\n* `Minter::mint` allows users to supply input `amount` tokens in `baseAsset` and receive output `amount` tokens in `hilBTCToken` with no adjustment for different decimal precision, exchanges rates or depeg events:\n```solidity\n    function mint(\n        address to,\n        uint256 amount\n    ) external onlyWhitelisted(msg.sender) onlyWhitelisted(to) nonReentrant {\n        baseAsset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);\n        hilBTCToken.mint(to, amount);\n        totalDeposits += amount;\n        emit Minted(to, amount);\n    }\n```\n\n**Impact:** There are multiple negative scenarios that can arise, but the most significant examples are:\n1) `baseAsset` represents a wrapped form of bitcoin which uses 8 decimal places (eg wBTC) but has currently depegged and is not worth anywhere near the actual bitcoin price:\n* user buys wBTC very cheap from a decentralized exchange due to the depeg\n* user calls `Minter::mint` passing `amount = 1e8` (normally worth 1 BTC but now worth far less due to the depeg)\n* user receives 1e8 worth of `hBTC` where 1 BTC is 1e8\n* user can then drain x/hBTC liquidity pools since they were credited 1 BTC worth of hBTC even though they didn't provide 1 BTC worth of wBTC since wBTC has depegged\n* in the kick-off call notes it states that hBTC can always be redeemed for BTC at a 1:1 ratio, so this may also be another way to drain reserves though this likely involves off-chain components\n* user could also stake the hBTC to earn more yield than they should though this is less immediately impactful\n\n2) `baseAsset` represents a stablecoin such as USDC:\n* user deposits 1e6 ($1)\n* user receives 1e6 worth of `hBTC` which is currently worth around $1,180\n* user can then drain x/hBTC liquidity pools and other similar scenarios as 1) above\n\n**Recommended Mitigation:** `Minter` in its current form can only be safely used with wrapped BTC representations that use 8 decimal places - the first option is to enforce this is the case in the `constructor` and remove the comment stating that `baseAsset` can be multiple different assets.\n\nHowever as noted `baseAsset` is intended to be many other different assets eg:\n```solidity\n    /// @notice The token address of the base asset accepted for deposit (e.g., WBTC or a stablecoin)\n    IERC20 public immutable baseAsset;\n```\n\nTo support different `baseAsset` as the code currently intends, the `mint` and `redeem` functions will need to account for:\n* differences in decimal precision between `baseAsset` and `hilBTCToken`\n* exchange rates between `baseAsset` and `hilBTCToken`\n* alternatively rename `hilBTCToken` to `hilSyntheticToken` and ensure that the synthetic token is always the equivalent of `baseAsset`\n\nThe code also needs to handle depeg events where the `baseAsset` even if `wBTC` can depeg and be worth far less than actual bitcoin, but `hBTC` is always redeemable 1:1 for native `BTC`. So if a depeg has occurred minting or redeem should revert. The ideal way to implement this check is via Chainlink price feeds, reverting if a depeg has occurred.\n\nIf Chainlink is not available on specific chains a secondary option could be Uniswap V3 TWAP. A third option could be making the `Minter` contract pausable and having an off-chain bot monitor `baseAsset` for depegs then pause the contract should a depeg occur - but this introduces additional risk related to the offchain bot not functioning correctly.\n\n**Syntetika:**\nIn commits [a70110c](https://github.com/SyntetikaLabs/monorepo/commit/a70110c1399c49667c2ef5b12e7b1d2354c02509), [db8c139](https://github.com/SyntetikaLabs/monorepo/commit/db8c139954cf8beb1b280b8aed78716554821ece) we:\n* changed the comments and renamed `hilBTCToken` to `hilSyntheticToken` so it is more generic to support different synthetic token types for different instances of `Minter`\n* implemented a decimal matching check inside the constructor such that `baseAsset` and `hilSyntheticToken` must use the same decimal precision\n\nThe intention was that the `Minter` contract shouldn't support stablecoin -> `hBTC` exchanges, but that in each instance of the `Minter` contract the `baseAsset` would be paired with a matching synthetic token.\n\nIn commits [20045e0](https://github.com/SyntetikaLabs/monorepo/commit/20045e0dc9907c352491bdb343af62a2257b86b7), [2e308e8](https://github.com/SyntetikaLabs/monorepo/commit/2e308e82340336cc9ba5fdea87340099091f26ec) we added pausing functionality to core `Minter` functions. An off-chain bot will monitor the `baseAsset` of each `Minter` instance and pause that instance if it detects a depeg.\n\n**Cyfrin:** Verified; we note that the introduction of the off-chain bot responsible for monitoring `baseAsset` for depegs and pausing the correct `Minter` instance introduces an additional risk if this process malfunctions.\n\n\\clearpage",
    "summary": "\nThe Minter contract has a bug that allows users to exploit the system by depositing a depegged baseAsset, such as wBTC, and receiving a larger amount of hBTC in return. This can lead to draining of liquidity pools and other negative scenarios. To fix this issue, the Minter contract should only support wrapped BTC representations that use 8 decimal places. Alternatively, the code can be modified to account for differences in decimal precision and exchange rates between baseAsset and hilBTCToken. Additionally, the contract should handle depeg events and revert if a depeg has occurred. The Syntetika team has made changes to the contract to address these issues, but there is still a risk if the off-chain bot responsible for monitoring baseAsset malfunctions. ",
