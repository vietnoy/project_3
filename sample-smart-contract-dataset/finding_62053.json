Assuming all other conditions are met, forced transfers with amount zero succeed:\n\n**src/MUSD.sol:L166-L178**\n\n```\nfunction _forceTransfer(address frozenAccount, address recipient, uint256 amount) internal {\n    _revertIfInvalidRecipient(recipient);\n    _revertIfNotFrozen(frozenAccount);\n\n    emit Transfer(frozenAccount, recipient, amount);\n    emit ForcedTransfer(frozenAccount, recipient, msg.sender, amount);\n\n    if (amount == 0) return;\n\n    _revertIfInsufficientBalance(frozenAccount, balanceOf(frozenAccount), amount);\n\n    _update(frozenAccount, recipient, amount);\n}\n```\n\nThis behavior mimics regular transfers, which also succeed for amount zero – which is, in fact, mandated by the [ERC-20 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20):\n\n> *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.\n\nHowever, it is debatable whether forced transfers should indeed behave in the same way regarding zero-amount transfers: Unlike regular transfers, forced transfers move someone else’s funds without permission and should, therefore, be considered exceptional occurrences. Initiating a forced transfer without effect is most likely a mistake in the first place, and reverting might be considered beneficial in such a scenario.\n\n#### Recommendation\n\nConsider making forced transfers with amount zero revert, even if all other conditions for a forced transfer are met.",
