However, as per the comment in the contract, these values should be set to 0.25%. This misconfiguration will result in the partner and referrer receiving a less bonus from the total cost of the bought credits than intended.\n\n```solidity\nuint16 public constant PARTNER_FEE = 250; \n// 0.25% bonus for the partner/marketing agency \n// if linked to a referrer (deduced from protocol fee)\nuint16 public constant PARTNER_REFERRER_BONUS = 250; \n// 0.25% bonus for the referrer \n// if linked to a partner (deduced from protocol fee)\n```\n\n## Recommendations\n\nUpdate the values of `PARTNER_FEE` and `PARTNER_REFERRER_BONUS` to 2500 ppm (0.25%) to match the intended values.\n\n\n\n",
    "summary": "\nThe report is about a bug in the `VisibilityCredits` contract. The severity of the bug is low, but the likelihood of it occurring is high. The bug is related to the incorrect setting of two values, `PARTNER_FEE` and `PARTNER_REFERRER_BONUS`, which are currently set to 250 ppm (0.025%) instead of the intended 0.25%. This means that partners and referrers will receive a lower bonus than intended from the total cost of bought credits. The recommendation is to update the values to 2500 ppm (0.25%) to fix the bug.",
