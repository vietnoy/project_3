    "content": "\n_Resolved_\n\nThe `staking.cairo` contract declares `CONTRACT_VERSION: felt252 = '2.0.0'`, but this is supposed to be version `3.0.0` (the new BTC staking version) since the currently deployed contract is already version 2.0.0.\n\nThis creates confusion for version tracking when the `version()` functions are queried.\n\nNote that there is also an inconsistency in other contracts, for example, the minting_curve contract has significant changes, but its CONTRACT_VERSION still points at `1.0.0` this should be changed.\nThe same applies for the pool contract, as it also points at `2.0.0` but should be `3.0.0` to show the pool contract is for the new BTC pools too.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nUpdate the contract version to reflect the correct versions\nExample;\n```rust\n// staking.cairo\npub const CONTRACT_VERSION: felt252 = '3.0.0';\n```\n\n\n\n",
