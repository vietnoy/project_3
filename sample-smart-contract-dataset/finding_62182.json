    "title": "[L-09] Re-adding removed vault assets duplicates accounting in `lastTotalAssets`",
    "content": "\n_Acknowledged_\n\nWhen a strategy vault is removed via emergency removal while it still holds assets (`strategy.balanceOf(address(EulerEarn)) > 0`), these unrecoverable assets are added to the `lostAssets` variable in `_accruedFeeAndAssets()`:\n\n```solidity\n function _accruedFeeAndAssets()\n        internal\n        view\n        returns (uint256 feeShares, uint256 newTotalAssets, uint256 newLostAssets)\n    {\n        // The assets that the Earn vault has on the strategy vaults.\n        uint256 realTotalAssets;\n        for (uint256 i; i < withdrawQueue.length; ++i) {\n            IERC4626 id = withdrawQueue[i];\n            realTotalAssets += _expectedSupplyAssets(id);\n        }\n\n        uint256 lastTotalAssetsCached = lastTotalAssets;\n        if (realTotalAssets < lastTotalAssetsCached - lostAssets) {\n            // If the vault lost some assets (realTotalAssets decreased), lostAssets is increased.\n            newLostAssets = lastTotalAssetsCached - realTotalAssets;\n        } else {\n            // If it did not, lostAssets stays the same.\n            newLostAssets = lostAssets;\n        }\n\n        newTotalAssets = realTotalAssets + newLostAssets;\n        uint256 totalInterest = newTotalAssets - lastTotalAssetsCached;\n       //...\n    }\n```\n\nHowever, **if the same vault is later re-added** to the `EulerEarn` vault, it is treated as a fresh strategy and added to the `withdrawQueue`. During this process, its configuration is initialized with `marketConfig.balance = id.balanceOf(address(this))`. Since this balance still contains the previously lost shares, **those same assets are now re-counted in `totalAssets()`, leading to double counting**:\n\n```solidity\nfunction _setCap(IERC4626 id, uint136 supplyCap) internal {\n        //...\n        if (supplyCap > 0) {\n            IERC20(asset()).forceApproveMaxWithPermit2(address(id), permit2);\n\n            if (!marketConfig.enabled) {\n                withdrawQueue.push(id);\n\n                //...\n                marketConfig.balance = id.balanceOf(address(this)).toUint112();\n\n                // Take into account assets of the new vault without applying a fee.\n                _updateLastTotalAssets(lastTotalAssets + _expectedSupplyAssets(id));\n\n                //...\n            }\n\n            //...\n        } else {\n            IERC20(asset()).revokeApprovalWithPermit2(address(id), permit2);\n        }\n\n        //...\n    }\n```\n\nThis results in an inflated `totalAssets()` value, which raises the share price of the `EaulerEarn` vault. Consequently, users interacting with the vault (e.g., minting) may receive fewer shares than they should.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nAvoid initializing re-added strategy vaults with their current balance. Instead, explicitly set `marketConfig.balance = 0` when adding a vault that was previously removed.\n\n### Euler comments\n\nWe acknowledge the finding, will keep as is. Behaviour is the same in the original codebase.\n\n\n\n",
