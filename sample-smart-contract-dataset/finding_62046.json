Addressed in: `d12a86a0dc8ff02043d00b6f60b0a1823c08d4f3`. The client provided the following explanation:\n\n> The contract is now checking to make sure that the total supply is not less than the sum of the expected allocations.\n\n**File(s) affected:**`SapTestToken.sol`\n\n**Description:** The`initialize()`function mints the amount of`_totalSupply`. However, there is no guarantee that it is the sum of all the expected allocations(1B tokens). If`_totalSupply`is less than the sum of all allocations, the vesting schedules will be created with amounts that can never be fully claimed. If`_totalSupply`is greater than 1B, the excess tokens will be minted to the Gnosis Safe but won't be part of any vesting schedule.\n\n**Recommendation:** Make sure that `_totalSupply` is equal to the sum of all the expected allocations. In case, it should be greater, modify the contract to reflect that and update the documentation.",
