    "content": "\n_Resolved_\n\nThe `burnToken()` function in `FunnelVaultUpgradeable` uses a direct ERC-20 transfer to the burn address but does not check the return value. If the token does not strictly follow ERC-20 standards (e.g a non-compliant token that returns false on failure, the vault would assume the burn succeeded even if it failed.\n\nIn such a case, the mapping is decremented and the event emitted, but the tokens remain in the contract. This results in token funds stuck in the vault (_since the vault thinks they were burned_) and potential accounting inconsistencies. For instance, a token like USDT (which doesn’t revert on failure) could silently fail to transfer, leaving the vault holding tokens that are no longer tracked in burnFees.\n\nRecommendation is to add a check if transfer is successful, and if not, revert the trx.\n\n\n\n",
