    "content": "\nAs per the documentation, function addInformationForServiceExecution() is mostly intended to be used by the creator to upload the information data about the X post created for a specific proposal (i.e. executionNonce). The issue is here is that the function does not validate the executionNonce to be less than the global `executionNonces` value. This allows the creator or dispute resolver to pre-populate information data for future nonces that are not existent yet. This does not seem to pose an on-chain threat currently, but the function does emit the `ServiceExecutionInformation`, which could be consumed differently by off-chain processes. Such behaviour should be disallowed, as it is not part of the intended flow.\n```solidity\n    function addInformationForServiceExecution(\n        uint256 serviceNonce,\n        uint256 executionNonce,\n        string calldata informationData\n    ) external {\n        VisibilityServicesStorage storage $ = _getVisibilityServicesStorage();\n\n        Service storage service = $.services[serviceNonce];\n        Execution storage execution = service.executions[executionNonce];\n```\n\n\n\n",
