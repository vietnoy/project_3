    "title": "Upgradeability pattern inconsistency in KeystoreAccount contract",
    "content": "## Severity: Low Risk\n\n## Context\nKeystoreAccount.sol#L15\n\n## Description\nThe `KeystoreAccount` contract implements an inconsistent upgradeability pattern. The `KeystoreAccountFactory` deploys all account instances behind ERC1967 proxies, which indicates an intention for these contracts to be upgradeable. However, the `KeystoreAccount` implementation does not implement functions to handle upgradeability (for example, it does not inherit from OpenZeppelin's `UUPSUpgradeable` contract), which means the deployed proxies lack the necessary functions to perform upgrades.\n\nIt's worth noting that the ERC-4337 explicitly states that \"most of ERC-4337 Smart Contract Account will be upgradeable.\" So, this mismatch creates unnecessary ambiguity that may result in unexpected behaviors or missing intended functionality.\n\n## Recommendation\nConsider documenting the intended upgradeability behavior clearly in the system specification to prevent future confusion, and implement the missing upgradeability features (with the necessary access controls) if `KeystoreAccount` contracts are intended to be upgradeable.\n\n## Stackup\nFor maximum simplicity, the `KeystoreAccount` does NOT have a built-in path for upgradeability. Fixed in PR 49.\n\n## Spearbit\nFix verified.",
