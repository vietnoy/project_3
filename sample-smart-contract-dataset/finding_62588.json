    "content": "\n_Resolved_\n\nReference Finding: https://solodit.cyfrin.io/issues/fuel1-5-use-safetransferfrom-instead-of-transferfrom-for-erc721-transfers-hexens-none-fuel-markdown\n\nThe `PacketStore` contract utilizes the transferFrom method to transfer NFTs, which is not the recommended approach for `ERC721` tokens. The `transferFrom` method does not perform any checks to ensure that the recipient is capable of receiving the NFT.\n\n```solidity\n        // Transfer packet to buyer\n        packetContract.transferFrom(address(this), recipient, packetId);\n        \n        emit PacketSold(packetId, recipient, price, packetTypeId);\n        \n```\n\nIf the recipient is a contract that does not implement the required `ERC721` interface, the NFT could be permanently locked, as it would not be able to be transferred out of that contract.\n\nNote:\nThis is the same in other contracts, including `CardAllocationPool` and `SpinLottery`.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nTo enhance the safety of NFT transfers, it is advisable to use the `safeTransferFrom` method instead of `transferFrom`.\n\n\n\n",
