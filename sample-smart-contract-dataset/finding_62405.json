    "content": "**Severity:** Low\n\n**Path:** src/vault/LogarithmVault.sol#L408-L419, src/vault/LogarithmVault.sol#L762-L764\n\n**Description:** If the priority is changed after a withdraw request is made, the withdrawal might not be able to be claimed.\nThe issue is that the withdrawRequest saves the `accRequestedWithdrawAssets` without noting whether the `owner` was prioritized. Upon claiming, `accRequestedWithdrawAssets` was used in conjunction with `isPrioritized`, which may not match `accRequestedWithdrawAssets`.\n\nFor example, let's assume the `prioritizedAccRequestedWithdrawAssets` is 1e18, while `accRequestedWithdrawAssets` is 10e18.\n\n- Lines 408 - 419: If an `owner` requested withdrawal before they are prioritized, the `accRequestedWithdrawAssets` of their withdrawRequest will be set as `10e18 + assetsToRequest`. \n\n\n- Lines 762 - 764: Afterwards, the `owner` was prioritized. The withdrawRequest's `accRequestedWithdrawAssets` will be compared against `$.prioritizedProcessedWithdrawAssets`. In this case it would be 1e18, therefore the withdrawal will not be able to be claimed.\n\nIt is reversable; if the `owner` should be not anymore prioritized, they can then claim their withdrawal.\n```\nif (isPrioritized(owner)) {\n    _accRequestedWithdrawAssets = $.prioritizedAccRequestedWithdrawAssets + assetsToRequest;\n    $.prioritizedAccRequestedWithdrawAssets = _accRequestedWithdrawAssets;\n} else {\n    _accRequestedWithdrawAssets = $.accRequestedWithdrawAssets + assetsToRequest;\n    $.accRequestedWithdrawAssets = _accRequestedWithdrawAssets;\n}\n\n\nbytes32 withdrawKey = getWithdrawKey(owner, _useNonce(owner));\n$.withdrawRequests[withdrawKey] = WithdrawRequest({\n    requestedAssets: assetsToRequest,\n    accRequestedWithdrawAssets: _accRequestedWithdrawAssets,\n```\n```\nisExecuted = isPrioritizedAccount\n    ? accRequestedWithdrawAssetsOfRequest <= $.prioritizedProcessedWithdrawAssets\n    : accRequestedWithdrawAssetsOfRequest <= $.processedWithdrawAssets;\n```\n\n**Remediation:**  Consider saving the priority at the time of requestWithdraw.\n\n**Status:** Fixed\n\n- - -",
