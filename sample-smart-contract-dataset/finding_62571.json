    "content": "\n_Acknowledged_\n\nIn the `CardAllocationPool` contract, the assignment of the `redeemManagerRoleId` is done during the initialization phase, requiring the role ID to be specified explicitly.\n\n```solidity\n       packetNFTAddress = packetAddress;\n        cardNFTAddress = cardAddress;\n        redeemManagerRoleId = _redeemManagerRoleId;\n        __RoleBasedAccessControlConsumer_init(_rbac);\n        __UUPSUpgradeable_init();\n```\n\nThis approach differs from other contracts, such as the `Card` contract, where role IDs like `REDEEM_MANAGER_ROLE` are directly defined as constants.\n\n```solidity\n    /// @notice Role identifier for accounts that can manage card redemptions\n    /// @dev Used in access control checks for redemption operations\n    uint256 public constant REDEEM_MANAGER_ROLE = 4;\n```\n\nThis inconsistency introduces redundancy and increases the risk of errors. If the `redeemManagerRoleId` overlaps with other role IDs, such as `PRICE_MANAGER_ROLE`, it could inadvertently grant excessive privileges to unrelated roles.\n\nNote: the same applies for `marketplaceManagerRoleId` used in `Marketplace` and `lotteryManagerRoleId` used in `SpinLottery`.\n\nTo enhance consistency and reduce the risk of errors, consider defining all role IDs as constants within the contract.\n\n\n\n",
