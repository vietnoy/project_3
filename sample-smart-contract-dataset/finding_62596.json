    "content": "\n_Resolved_\n\n## Severity\n\n**Impact:** Medium\n\n**Likelihood:** Medium\n\n## Description\n\nIn the `CardAllocationPool` contract, when random card NFTs are being allocated to the owner (the owner of the `packetId`), if the `sendNFTs` function fails to transfer the selected cards, **these cards will be permanently stuck in the contract**:\n\n```solidity\n function fulfillRandomWords(uint256 requestId, uint256[] memory randomWords) internal {\n        //...\n\n        // Select random cards using the provided randomness\n        uint256[] memory selectedCards = selectRandomCards(cardBundles, randomWords[0]);\n\n        // Transfer cards to owner\n        try this.sendNFTS(selectedCards, request.owner) {\n            RipFunPacks(packetNFTAddress).finalizeOpen(request.packetId, selectedCards, \"\");\n            emit PacketOpenFulfilled(requestId, request.packetId, selectedCards);\n        } catch {}\n\n        //...\n    }\n```\n\nThe `sendNFTS()` invocation occurs within a `try/catch` block, where the catch does not revert any state changes or implement any functionality to reallocate the failed-to-send `selectedCards`. As a result, the cards remain **permanently stuck in the contract** and can not be re-utilized in future random selections. Additionally, there is no mechanism to allow the redeem manager to recover these cards.\n\nSince the `cardBundles` are removed from the `packetTypeToCardBundles` array, the physical items associated with these cards NFTs **become permanently unredeemable**.\n\nA similar issue in `SpinLottery.fulfillRandomness()` function when `_distributePrize()` fails.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nImplement a mechanism to re-add the failed-to-send cards NFTs to the `packetTypeToCardBundles` array, or introduce a mechanism to enable the redeem manager to recover these cards NFTs.\n\n\n\n",
    "summary": "\nThe bug report is about an issue in the `CardAllocationPool` contract where randomly selected cards are getting stuck and cannot be used again. This happens when the `sendNFTs` function fails to transfer the selected cards to the owner. The problem is that there is no mechanism in place to re-add these cards or allow the redeem manager to recover them. This also causes physical items associated with these cards to become permanently unredeemable. The report recommends implementing a mechanism to re-add the stuck cards or allowing the redeem manager to recover them.",
