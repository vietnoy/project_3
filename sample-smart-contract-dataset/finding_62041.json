Addressed in: `2814cd4533d30b7bcf50721f34eb348edeb3b493`. The client provided the following explanation:\n\n> The vulnerability was fixed by implementing proper access control in the SapTestToken contract.\n\n**File(s) affected:**`SapienRewards.sol, SapTestToken.sol`\n\n**Description:** The `releaseTokens()` function in the `SapTestToken` contract lacks access control, allowing any address to call it. The intention is that it is only callable via the `SapienRewards.releaseTokenRewards()` function by the owner of that contract. However, a user is able to bypass this and instead directly call `releaseTokens()` on the `SapTestToken` contract.\n\n**Recommendation:** Consider adding a check within `SapTestToken.releaseTokens()` to ensure that the caller is the `SapienRewards` contract address.",
    "summary": "\nThe client has marked a bug as \"Fixed\" and provided an explanation for the fix. The bug was related to the `releaseTokens()` function in the `SapTestToken` contract, which did not have proper access control. This allowed any address to call the function, instead of just the owner of the `SapienRewards` contract. The recommendation is to add a check in the `releaseTokens()` function to ensure that only the `SapienRewards` contract can call it. This bug has been addressed in the code and marked as fixed by the client.",
