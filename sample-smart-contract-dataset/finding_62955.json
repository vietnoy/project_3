    "content": "\n_Acknowledged_\n\nIn the current design, the Fixed Side investor’s liquidity can be added to the Uniswap V3 pool and begin generating trading fees **before** the Vault officially starts (`isStarted == false`).\n\nHowever, once the Vault is started, these **pre-start fees become indistinguishable from post-start fees**, and may be indirectly distributed to Variable Side investors during withdrawal or claim processes. This creates an **economic imbalance**, where:\n\n* The Fixed Side investor **assumes all early risk** and provides capital to the pool,\n* While Variable Side investors **may benefit from pre-start fees** without contributing any risk or capital during that time.\n\nThis behavior contradicts the intended design of the Vault, in which Variable Side investors are expected to earn yield **only** from post-start activity.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nIntroduce a mechanism to **isolate or attribute pre-start fees**, such as:\n\n* In `start()`, call `collect()` and assign all accumulated pre-start fees exclusively to the Fixed Side investor before enabling Variable Side participation.\n* Alternatively, track and subtract pre-start fees from total earnings, ensuring that Variable Side investors only benefit from fees earned **after** the Vault has officially started.\n\n\n",
